We have just spent a week at Suitenhotel Zurbriggen, over Christmas, and it is absolutely one of the best places we have ever stayed. It is without a doubt our most memorable Christmas holiday. From the moment we arrived we were commenting that it looked exactly as it had in the pictures! We stayed in the Streif apartment with our 2 young daughters in travel cots. The suite was beautifully appointed and the views were breathtaking. If I took 1 photo, I took 100 photos of the view from our room and balcony at every time of day. We were a bit apprehensive about having breakfast brought to the room on a tray, but like others have said, this is such a treat. You can choose what you would like and what time you would like it, and the serves are very generous. We miss our daily breakfast tray already...! The pool, jacuzzi and wellness spa downstairs is just as it is looks in the photos - magical. We had very heavy snow over Christmas and Boxing Day which made it all the more magical sitting outside in the Jacuzzi with the glittering Christmas tree and reindeer, looking up at the Matterhorn. Our young daughters loved the indoor pool, and we loved escaping to the sauna and steam room once the girls were asleep. The location is excellent; across the road from the gondola station and a 10-15 min stroll into town (with baby and toddler in tow!). The owners, Pirmin and Moni Zurbriggen, were on site throughout the duration of our stay and it is evident that they are very dedicated to the daily operation of their wonderful property - such attention to detail and this flows down to the excellent service by all other staff (a special thank you to Annette, Clementine and the lovely housekeeping ladies too!). Such an honour to meet a ski champion the like of Pirmin! We planned our 2.5 week Switzerland holiday around staying at Suitenhotel Zurbriggen due to the excellent TripAdvisor reviews and yet again, TripAdvisor you have outdone yourself! Everything about this hotel is absolute perfection. We hope to return one day. Happy New Year to the lovely Zurbriggen family and your wonderful staff!
