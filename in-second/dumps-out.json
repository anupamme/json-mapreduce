The weather wasn't great but we were more than happy to spend time in the hotel. Service was fantastic and we had lunch in the restaurant while our room was made up. We had a great room size with a lovely walk through bathroom. Everything was spotless. Staff all very helpful, friendly and professional. We had dinner and drinks at the New York bar on the 52nd floor with fantastic live jazz. It was also great for people watching too. Our nachos and burgers and fries were on time and delicious as were the drinks. Staff were very attentive and polite. We happened to sit at a section of the bar where you could smoke but this didn't affect us too much. A wonderful experience, I wish I could go back right now. Staff very helpful when we were arranging transport to the airport and the scheduled mini-bus was already full - they arranged for the airport bus at the Hyatt around the corner to come and pick us up on time.

Part of our in-Japan honeymoon. I already had the opportunity to stay in PHT last year for business for about a week. I came back with the same joy! Of course this is probably the best hotel in Tokyo, nothing to say in the quality of the service with almost 2staff/guest in average. Excellent. Dinner at the New York Grill, a la carte grilled beef. Very good food, amazing view. After a cocktail at the NY Bar, jazz concert every night, I recommend you'd try their specials like the LIT and Yuzu Gin Tonic, both not too strong cocktails. Breakfast Japanese or Western (western is a buffet), we took Japanese, very nice variety of rice and Japanese specialities. Amazing view of Fuji-San by clear weather, and of the city anytime (Tokyo skytree, Yoyogi park, Docomo Tower...). Lots of small cute attentions for us as a honeymoon couple.

There were no high rises except for Tokyo Tower! We stayed at the Palace hotel and traveled from Tokyo to Nagoya with my host family on their fabulous train system. I was in absolute shock when I returned to Japan in October after 50 years! It was taller and cleaner than most US cities. The international airport was Haneda in 1964, which is now the regional airport. The brand new international is Narita, almost 2 hours at 70 MPH from Tokyo! We took a cab to the hotel, the only sane way to get around! We were tired upon arriving from such a long flight and had a light dinner in the lounge. From that point on, the food and service was always good. Breakfast buffet, included in our tour rate, was delicious and served sushi as well! Custom orders of eggs are served to the table hot and delicious.(I don't recommend the French restaurant for other meals. Lousy service yucky food. We walked out after tasting the 1st course. It cause a bit of a fracas, but the hotel manager handled it efficiently and gracefully.) We needed to call home and found out the USA cell phones are on a different wave length from Japan's. The managers at the desk helped us with the somewhat different computer system to send e-mails. Our room was on the 32nd floor. The hotel starts on the 25th floor with offices below. Staff, service and housekeeping was great. The location is central and it is walkable to Tokyo tower and the Ginza in a very few minutes. Next door to the hotel is a nice shopping center that has a station for the metro. I recommend the Park Hyatt for a comfortable and attractive home base for Tokyo. We met the Smithsonian Institute tour group there for our almost 3 week tour of Japan. I recommend their choice of this hotel.

We were met at the ground level and accompanied all the way up to check-in on the 41st floor. The rooms are located on the 42nd to 51st stories of a beautiful modern highrise, perfectly located near many attractions. The views from the rooms are nothing short of spectacular. I favor the same view as that of the New York Bar and would request it. The rooms are clean, modern and efficient. There is a very well stocked bar. Bose stereo in the bathroom for music along with a TV. Nice separate shower and bath along with the high tech toilet. The service was friendly and extremely helpful. I gave the concierge my itinerary and they booked all of my train tickets, and returned them along with a printed itinerary of my trip by the next day. The rooftop pool and workout facility is awesome, all glass and again, spectacular views from all sides. The spa was excellent and the services some of the best, including a wonderful Swedish massage. There is a large selelction of restaurants to choose from at the hotel, including the New York Bar and Grill. I preferred eating at the bar as the restaurant prices are steep and don't offer much value. Wonderful Jazz trio all six nights of our stay in the bar. The breakfast is one of the best I have ever had at a hotel. Included in our breakfast was a large buffet, any hot items we wanted off the menu, smoothies, juices, and coffees ect.., all included in the room price. I have never seen that anywhere. You could graze at breakfast for hours, enjoying the view and skip lunch. Unlike other reviewers, our breakfast service was great. The hotel is connected to an office complex with a U.S. ATM and another dozen or so restaurants that are less expensive if budget is an issue.

The service: I can't say anything other than perfect. Every employee. Just perfect. Sets this hotel apart from so many other hotels/resorts I've been to.

While you don't want to lug a ton of baggage walking from Shinjuku station to the hotel, the hotel does offer a complimentary shuttle to/from a point near Shinjuku station, and the cab ride is generally not that bad (800-1,000 JPY). Furthermore, if you're just walking around the city, it's a perfect walking distance to Shinjuku Station as well as beautiful parks like Yoyogi (and its landmarks). It's also walkable to the Kabukicho district, home of awesome night life (including the ridiculous Robot Restaurant) and the Calico Cat Cafe (if you love cats).

I was super excited to stay at such an iconic hotel, not least because i was a huge fan of the film Lost in Translation. However, we came away thinking it was not the perfect hotel and whilst it has some amazing aspects, there were also some surprising things which we just didn't expect at a five star hotel. Earlier in our trip we had stayed at the Conrad hotel which I must say was much better in terms of overall service and value and is a beautiful hotel in its own right. The great thing about this hotel is location, the pool and of course the New York Bar. The bar and grill is amazing and rightly deserves its status as one of the world's best, the view is spectacular and really is worth seeing. However we were amazing that despite paying \u00c2\u00a3400+ a night you have to pay extra to use the spa/jacuzzi facilities. That just seemed like poor value and especially when we had just come from the conrad where all amenities are included in the room rate. The other issue was the service at breakfast, twice when we ate the hot food was cold and it took an age for them to replace it. They also took such a long time bringing coffee and the bill it wasn't even that busy. Given the price, the least i would expect is a breakfast where the hot ingredients are actually hot. It's not that it was awful service but we are talking about one of the worlds great hotels here and so I was just amazed they operated at those standards. Having stayed at the Park Hyatt and the Conrad, if i return to Tokyo, i'd opt for the conrad. The overall service and amenities there are what you would expect from a high-end 5 star hotel. The Park Hyatt is beautiful and the views over Tokyo are simply amazing but it wouldn't rank amongst the truly great 5 star hotels I have stayed in around the world.", "Place": "London, United Kingdom", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/68/avatar046.jpg", "Date": "25 November 2014", "management_response": "", "Badges": "18 reviews 11 hotel reviews Reviews in 9 cities 19 helpful votes", "Rooms": "4 of 5 stars"}, {"rating": "5 of 5 stars", "room_tip": "", "ReviewerName": "Tatsumasa S", "traveled_as": "Stayed November 2014, travelled with family", "Service": "5 of 5 stars", "title": "Hotel that you wouldn't want to leave!", "review": "We stayed for a few days.

If you're on business and you need to connect your laptop, iPad and smart phone at once and you don't have an adaptor then you're in trouble. So a message to the management - even in places like Vietnam they have multi plug power points.

The bar and grill is amazing and rightly deserves its status as one of the world's best, the view is spectacular and really is worth seeing. However we were amazing that despite paying \u00c2\u00a3400+ a night you have to pay extra to use the spa/jacuzzi facilities. That just seemed like poor value and especially when we had just come from the conrad where all amenities are included in the room rate. The other issue was the service at breakfast, twice when we ate the hot food was cold and it took an age for them to replace it. They also took such a long time bringing coffee and the bill it wasn't even that busy. Given the price, the least i would expect is a breakfast where the hot ingredients are actually hot. It's not that it was awful service but we are talking about one of the worlds great hotels here and so I was just amazed they operated at those standards. Having stayed at the Park Hyatt and the Conrad, if i return to Tokyo, i'd opt for the conrad. The overall service and amenities there are what you would expect from a high-end 5 star hotel. The Park Hyatt is beautiful and the views over Tokyo are simply amazing but it wouldn't rank amongst the truly great 5 star hotels I have stayed in around the world.", "Place": "London, United Kingdom", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/68/avatar046.jpg", "Date": "25 November 2014", "management_response": "", "Badges": "18 reviews 11 hotel reviews Reviews in 9 cities 19 helpful votes", "Rooms": "4 of 5 stars"}, {"rating": "5 of 5 stars", "room_tip": "", "ReviewerName": "Tatsumasa S", "traveled_as": "Stayed November 2014, travelled with family", "Service": "5 of 5 stars", "title": "Hotel that you wouldn't want to leave!", "review": "We stayed for a few days.

There were no high rises except for Tokyo Tower! We stayed at the Palace hotel and traveled from Tokyo to Nagoya with my host family on their fabulous train system. I was in absolute shock when I returned to Japan in October after 50 years! It was taller and cleaner than most US cities. The international airport was Haneda in 1964, which is now the regional airport. The brand new international is Narita, almost 2 hours at 70 MPH from Tokyo! We took a cab to the hotel, the only sane way to get around! We were tired upon arriving from such a long flight and had a light dinner in the lounge. From that point on, the food and service was always good. Breakfast buffet, included in our tour rate, was delicious and served sushi as well! Custom orders of eggs are served to the table hot and delicious.(I don't recommend the French restaurant for other meals. Lousy service yucky food. We walked out after tasting the 1st course. It cause a bit of a fracas, but the hotel manager handled it efficiently and gracefully.) We needed to call home and found out the USA cell phones are on a different wave length from Japan's. The managers at the desk helped us with the somewhat different computer system to send e-mails. Our room was on the 32nd floor. The hotel starts on the 25th floor with offices below. Staff, service and housekeeping was great. The location is central and it is walkable to Tokyo tower and the Ginza in a very few minutes. Next door to the hotel is a nice shopping center that has a station for the metro. I recommend the Park Hyatt for a comfortable and attractive home base for Tokyo.

The service: I can't say anything other than perfect. Every employee. Just perfect. Sets this hotel apart from so many other hotels/resorts I've been to. The location: I found Shinjuku to be much more exciting than I had anticipated. While you don't want to lug a ton of baggage walking from Shinjuku station to the hotel, the hotel does offer a complimentary shuttle to/from a point near Shinjuku station, and the cab ride is generally not that bad (800-1,000 JPY). Furthermore, if you're just walking around the city, it's a perfect walking distance to Shinjuku Station as well as beautiful parks like Yoyogi (and its landmarks). It's also walkable to the Kabukicho district, home of awesome night life (including the ridiculous Robot Restaurant) and the Calico Cat Cafe (if you love cats). The breakfast (complimentary for Diamonds) was also fantastic! The made-to-order omelets were perfectly cooked, and the buffet spread was great (my favorites: bowls of fresh-cut kiwis and fresh croissants).

While you don't want to lug a ton of baggage walking from Shinjuku station to the hotel, the hotel does offer a complimentary shuttle to/from a point near Shinjuku station, and the cab ride is generally not that bad (800-1,000 JPY). Furthermore, if you're just walking around the city, it's a perfect walking distance to Shinjuku Station as well as beautiful parks like Yoyogi (and its landmarks). It's also walkable to the Kabukicho district, home of awesome night life (including the ridiculous Robot Restaurant) and the Calico Cat Cafe (if you love cats). The breakfast (complimentary for Diamonds) was also fantastic! The made-to-order omelets were perfectly cooked, and the buffet spread was great (my favorites: bowls of fresh-cut kiwis and fresh croissants). I can't stop gushing about this place, and I can't wait to come back! To the Park Hyatt Tokyo: thank you!!!

I was super excited to stay at such an iconic hotel, not least because i was a huge fan of the film Lost in Translation. However, we came away thinking it was not the perfect hotel and whilst it has some amazing aspects, there were also some surprising things which we just didn't expect at a five star hotel. Earlier in our trip we had stayed at the Conrad hotel which I must say was much better in terms of overall service and value and is a beautiful hotel in its own right. The great thing about this hotel is location, the pool and of course the New York Bar. The bar and grill is amazing and rightly deserves its status as one of the world's best, the view is spectacular and really is worth seeing. However we were amazing that despite paying \u00c2\u00a3400+ a night you have to pay extra to use the spa/jacuzzi facilities. That just seemed like poor value and especially when we had just come from the conrad where all amenities are included in the room rate. The other issue was the service at breakfast, twice when we ate the hot food was cold and it took an age for them to replace it. They also took such a long time bringing coffee and the bill it wasn't even that busy. Given the price, the least i would expect is a breakfast where the hot ingredients are actually hot. It's not that it was awful service but we are talking about one of the worlds great hotels here and so I was just amazed they operated at those standards. Having stayed at the Park Hyatt and the Conrad, if i return to Tokyo, i'd opt for the conrad. The overall service and amenities there are what you would expect from a high-end 5 star hotel. The Park Hyatt is beautiful and the views over Tokyo are simply amazing but it wouldn't rank amongst the truly great 5 star hotels I have stayed in around the world.", "Place": "London, United Kingdom", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/68/avatar046.jpg", "Date": "25 November 2014", "management_response": "", "Badges": "18 reviews 11 hotel reviews Reviews in 9 cities 19 helpful votes", "Rooms": "4 of 5 stars"}, {"rating": "5 of 5 stars", "room_tip": "", "ReviewerName": "Tatsumasa S", "traveled_as": "Stayed November 2014, travelled with family", "Service": "5 of 5 stars", "title": "Hotel that you wouldn't want to leave!", "review": "We stayed for a few days.

Even before I arrived, I received an email asking if I had any questions as well as what Tokyo has to offer and a way to get to the hotel from Narita. Since I was arriving at night, opted for the limo bus. Once at the hotel, every question was answered and everything provided to me. Loved it. General Stay and Amenities. Wow...wow..wow...everything exceeded my expectations. I travel a lot and this hotel even though is a boutique style, far exceeded what I expected. The rooms were not as tiny as France so that was fine by me. Sleep quality was also very good. From the rooms and how clean they are plus being provided with everything in your room-toothbrush, sleeping gowns, soaps-the scent was excellent to every little detail with the towels and all. Good job guys. Bonus was after a long and hustle walking of Tokyo, I could come back to the hotel, get to 3rd floor and enjoy a good long massage of my whole body-those chair massages are genius idea. They also have a gym and washing machine. For 300 yen, washed clothes. Location This place to me was so ideal and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to go to Tokyo. Stay at Hotel Niwa. Reason why, my flight from Seoul landed in Tokyo around 9 pm and you know how things shut down in Tokyo by midnight. I decided to take the limo bus to Tokyo Air Terminal and once there I took a taxi to the hotel..the taxi only costed me about 2000 yen. Way easier and cheaper for someone new to Tokyo. When it comes to leaving the hotel to go anywhere within Tokyo, this place had it all. And I rode all the train systems they have from Ronkai to JR and even Tokyo Subway. My advice is for you to download the Japan Train app as well as Tokyo subway. Those two things will take you anywhere you want to go to. Just walk from the hotel for 5 minutes and you are on the JR and another 1 minute from JR and you are on the Tokyo Subway. I bought daily passes based on where I was going to. If I was going to spend my day in Ginza and all, I would spend 1000 yen but if I was going to combine the train system, 1500 was enough for both. Food I do have to admit that spending 2370 yen on breakfast was too much for me. Unless it came as part of your package, I would say stay away no matter how good they are. Instead by the Tokyo subway, their is a pastry cafe there, cheap with a lot of choices. And in that regard, just there by the subway, you can go to the 5th floor in the evening and enjoy a good Japanese dinner with a breathtaking view of Tokyo Dome. To summarize, this hotel gave me everything I needed for my 1st visit to Tokyo. Loved it and should I go back to Tokyo, it is my home.", "Place": "New Brunswick, New Jersey", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/01/ce/57/84/neema46664.jpg", "Date": "28 November 2014", "management_response": "M3810, Guest Relations at Hotel Niwa Tokyo, responded to this review, 1 week ago Dear Neema 46664, Thank you so much for your kind words following your recent return stay at Hotel Niwa Tokyo.

Even before I arrived, I received an email asking if I had any questions as well as what Tokyo has to offer and a way to get to the hotel from Narita. Since I was arriving at night, opted for the limo bus. Once at the hotel, every question was answered and everything provided to me. Loved it. General Stay and Amenities. Wow...wow..wow...everything exceeded my expectations. I travel a lot and this hotel even though is a boutique style, far exceeded what I expected. The rooms were not as tiny as France so that was fine by me. Sleep quality was also very good. From the rooms and how clean they are plus being provided with everything in your room-toothbrush, sleeping gowns, soaps-the scent was excellent to every little detail with the towels and all. Good job guys. Bonus was after a long and hustle walking of Tokyo, I could come back to the hotel, get to 3rd floor and enjoy a good long massage of my whole body-those chair massages are genius idea.

Reason why, my flight from Seoul landed in Tokyo around 9 pm and you know how things shut down in Tokyo by midnight. I decided to take the limo bus to Tokyo Air Terminal and once there I took a taxi to the hotel..the taxi only costed me about 2000 yen. Way easier and cheaper for someone new to Tokyo. When it comes to leaving the hotel to go anywhere within Tokyo, this place had it all. And I rode all the train systems they have from Ronkai to JR and even Tokyo Subway. My advice is for you to download the Japan Train app as well as Tokyo subway. Those two things will take you anywhere you want to go to. Just walk from the hotel for 5 minutes and you are on the JR and another 1 minute from JR and you are on the Tokyo Subway. I bought daily passes based on where I was going to. If I was going to spend my day in Ginza and all, I would spend 1000 yen but if I was going to combine the train system, 1500 was enough for both. Food I do have to admit that spending 2370 yen on breakfast was too much for me. Unless it came as part of your package, I would say stay away no matter how good they are. Instead by the Tokyo subway, their is a pastry cafe there, cheap with a lot of choices. And in that regard, just there by the subway, you can go to the 5th floor in the evening and enjoy a good Japanese dinner with a breathtaking view of Tokyo Dome.

(on one of the days I had packages come and they even brought it up for me!) Anyways, We went up to our rooms and unpacked. The rooms are pretty small but we loved it. It was a modern room but had a traditional Japanese feel to it. They have a traditional Japanese restaurant as well as a western style restaurant. We tried both of them out. They are very good but it's not cheap. Still would recommend. The hotel is close to two train stations. Suidobashi and Ochanomizu. Both within a 10 min walk which made it easy to get around Tokyo. The location is also in a nice quiet area. Overall it was a lovely hotel, definitely exceeded our expectations. If I were to stay in Tokyo, I would stay here again.

Even before I arrived, I received an email asking if I had any questions as well as what Tokyo has to offer and a way to get to the hotel from Narita. Since I was arriving at night, opted for the limo bus. Once at the hotel, every question was answered and everything provided to me. Loved it. General Stay and Amenities. Wow...wow..wow...everything exceeded my expectations. I travel a lot and this hotel even though is a boutique style, far exceeded what I expected. The rooms were not as tiny as France so that was fine by me. Sleep quality was also very good. From the rooms and how clean they are plus being provided with everything in your room-toothbrush, sleeping gowns, soaps-the scent was excellent to every little detail with the towels and all. Good job guys. Bonus was after a long and hustle walking of Tokyo, I could come back to the hotel, get to 3rd floor and enjoy a good long massage of my whole body-those chair massages are genius idea. They also have a gym and washing machine. For 300 yen, washed clothes. Location This place to me was so ideal and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to go to Tokyo. Stay at Hotel Niwa. Reason why, my flight from Seoul landed in Tokyo around 9 pm and you know how things shut down in Tokyo by midnight. I decided to take the limo bus to Tokyo Air Terminal and once there I took a taxi to the hotel..the taxi only costed me about 2000 yen. Way easier and cheaper for someone new to Tokyo. When it comes to leaving the hotel to go anywhere within Tokyo, this place had it all. And I rode all the train systems they have from Ronkai to JR and even Tokyo Subway. My advice is for you to download the Japan Train app as well as Tokyo subway. Those two things will take you anywhere you want to go to. Just walk from the hotel for 5 minutes and you are on the JR and another 1 minute from JR and you are on the Tokyo Subway. I bought daily passes based on where I was going to. If I was going to spend my day in Ginza and all, I would spend 1000 yen but if I was going to combine the train system, 1500 was enough for both. Food I do have to admit that spending 2370 yen on breakfast was too much for me. Unless it came as part of your package, I would say stay away no matter how good they are. Instead by the Tokyo subway, their is a pastry cafe there, cheap with a lot of choices. And in that regard, just there by the subway, you can go to the 5th floor in the evening and enjoy a good Japanese dinner with a breathtaking view of Tokyo Dome. To summarize, this hotel gave me everything I needed for my 1st visit to Tokyo. Loved it and should I go back to Tokyo, it is my home.", "Place": "New Brunswick, New Jersey", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/01/ce/57/84/neema46664.jpg", "Date": "28 November 2014", "management_response": "M3810, Guest Relations at Hotel Niwa Tokyo, responded to this review, 1 week ago Dear Neema 46664, Thank you so much for your kind words following your recent return stay at Hotel Niwa Tokyo.

(on one of the days I had packages come and they even brought it up for me!) Anyways, We went up to our rooms and unpacked. The rooms are pretty small but we loved it. It was a modern room but had a traditional Japanese feel to it. They have a traditional Japanese restaurant as well as a western style restaurant. We tried both of them out. They are very good but it's not cheap. Still would recommend. The hotel is close to two train stations. Suidobashi and Ochanomizu. Both within a 10 min walk which made it easy to get around Tokyo. The location is also in a nice quiet area. Overall it was a lovely hotel, definitely exceeded our expectations. If I were to stay in Tokyo, I would stay here again.

Stayed in Junior Suite. Large room with two large beds, living room with very comfortable Sofa, refrigerator, with very good quality in-room self coffee maker, large size computer desk with plenty of power outlets. Room was large for holding business meetings of group of 4 comfortably. Staff is very respectful, attentive. Great number of outlets. Toilette separate from the bathroom. The bathroom includes a modern Jacuzzi and shower. Bathroom has high quality amenities for bath/shower, toothbrush, mouthwash, even toothbrush and razor. Cleaning service, towels were great. Temperature controls worked. Wish US hotels learn from industrial design features the hotel has as simple as power strips with multiple outlets with great separation elegantly and strategically placed next to bed and bed lights and located on the computer desk. Great gardens with walking/running paths surrounds the hotel. Zojoji Temple is right around the corner as historical site. Always taxi is available (730 Yen and up). In 10 days for my business spent equivalent of $400 for taxies which is not much considering multiple trips I had to take within Tokyo. There are close-by metro stations. Running in the early morning surrounded by Gardens were very nice. Due to time change, there were nights waking up very early and running in 4 am around the hotel, never felt unsafe at all. Overall Tokyo is a clean and my impression the place was very safe. The hotel has a decent gym and indoor swimming pool which was included in the room in my case. The Gym requires a long walk from the base of the hotel. The Basement has all sort of restaurants including Sushi, grill, steak house, tempura. Once I had Sushi dinner special for the hotel guests. Breakfast buffet I had in 33rd floor most mornings was great. For most rooms it may be included but not in my case which cost (I think) around $30, which is a great price for the great quality of food. Including hot and cold quality entries, some Japanese entries and soup. There is also small store in the hotel to buy pre-made sandwiches, drinks, beverages. Also has a great daily fresh bakery including croissants, some deserts, etc. Very good quality and not too sweet. I really like the hotel, modern, comfortable, very clean and very respectable and helpful hotel staff. If you are looking for a hotel in the middle of action, close to near by small restaurants etc. This is not the one. It is close to Tokyo Tower if you like to visit to see the Tokyo from birds eye view. The sound insulation is good but in night there was some street/traffic noise even though I was at 28th floor. So if you are sensitive to noise or looking for perfectly quite hotel, this may not be the one. Although I doubt there would any hotel in Tokyo without some street noise.

I arrived early and the fact that no rooms were available was fine. But the staff were very intent on reciting the rules, storing my bag and getting me out of the lobby, with no suggestions about where to recover for the intervening 5 hours. Travellers don't arrive early at hotels in order to create inconvenience for the staff; we are hostage to airline schedules. I was checking in for business, for a week, but asking to use the (small) business centre was clearly an out-of-left-field request. It would have been great to know that the tea lounge is exceptionally comfortable; that the gift shop/boulangerie sells fresh baked croissants; that the basement houses a superbly equipped gym and a full size thermal spring spa (for about USD 25); or that there is a terrific massage service downstairs, alongside the nail bar and the esthetic salon. Once past reception the rooms are large -- if unrenovated -- the service is terrific and the French restaurant on the 33rd floor has one of the best-priced dinner menus in town. I agree that the hotel has a lovely 1960s elegance vibe. Watch out for the breakfast buffet on weekends -- the influx of wedding parties, tour groups and Japanese holiday makers means that the lines are long; it is a destination brunch spot. Location is fine if you are happy to use the subway. There are no shops or restaurants close by but the hotel has a surprisingly well-stocked mini-supermarket, so self-catering and supplies are at hand. My suggestion is that management sends the entire front desk staff over to the Excel Tokyu Hotel in Akasaka-mitsuke to get some training on smiling, personable, 'how can we make you comfortable?' service training. (I returned a week later for a two day stay - same unsmiling check-in; same terrific service elsewhere).

I arrived early and the fact that no rooms were available was fine. But the staff were very intent on reciting the rules, storing my bag and getting me out of the lobby, with no suggestions about where to recover for the intervening 5 hours. Travellers don't arrive early at hotels in order to create inconvenience for the staff; we are hostage to airline schedules. I was checking in for business, for a week, but asking to use the (small) business centre was clearly an out-of-left-field request. It would have been great to know that the tea lounge is exceptionally comfortable; that the gift shop/boulangerie sells fresh baked croissants; that the basement houses a superbly equipped gym and a full size thermal spring spa (for about USD 25); or that there is a terrific massage service downstairs, alongside the nail bar and the esthetic salon. Once past reception the rooms are large -- if unrenovated -- the service is terrific and the French restaurant on the 33rd floor has one of the best-priced dinner menus in town. I agree that the hotel has a lovely 1960s elegance vibe. Watch out for the breakfast buffet on weekends -- the influx of wedding parties, tour groups and Japanese holiday makers means that the lines are long; it is a destination brunch spot. Location is fine if you are happy to use the subway. There are no shops or restaurants close by but the hotel has a surprisingly well-stocked mini-supermarket, so self-catering and supplies are at hand. My suggestion is that management sends the entire front desk staff over to the Excel Tokyu Hotel in Akasaka-mitsuke to get some training on smiling, personable, 'how can we make you comfortable?' service training. (I returned a week later for a two day stay - same unsmiling check-in; same terrific service elsewhere).

Stayed in Junior Suite. Large room with two large beds, living room with very comfortable Sofa, refrigerator, with very good quality in-room self coffee maker, large size computer desk with plenty of power outlets. Room was large for holding business meetings of group of 4 comfortably. Staff is very respectful, attentive. Great number of outlets. Toilette separate from the bathroom. The bathroom includes a modern Jacuzzi and shower. Bathroom has high quality amenities for bath/shower, toothbrush, mouthwash, even toothbrush and razor. Cleaning service, towels were great. Temperature controls worked. Wish US hotels learn from industrial design features the hotel has as simple as power strips with multiple outlets with great separation elegantly and strategically placed next to bed and bed lights and located on the computer desk. Great gardens with walking/running paths surrounds the hotel. Zojoji Temple is right around the corner as historical site. Always taxi is available (730 Yen and up). In 10 days for my business spent equivalent of $400 for taxies which is not much considering multiple trips I had to take within Tokyo. There are close-by metro stations. Running in the early morning surrounded by Gardens were very nice. Due to time change, there were nights waking up very early and running in 4 am around the hotel, never felt unsafe at all. Overall Tokyo is a clean and my impression the place was very safe. The hotel has a decent gym and indoor swimming pool which was included in the room in my case. The Gym requires a long walk from the base of the hotel. The Basement has all sort of restaurants including Sushi, grill, steak house, tempura. Once I had Sushi dinner special for the hotel guests. Breakfast buffet I had in 33rd floor most mornings was great. For most rooms it may be included but not in my case which cost (I think) around $30, which is a great price for the great quality of food. Including hot and cold quality entries, some Japanese entries and soup. There is also small store in the hotel to buy pre-made sandwiches, drinks, beverages. Also has a great daily fresh bakery including croissants, some deserts, etc. Very good quality and not too sweet. I really like the hotel, modern, comfortable, very clean and very respectable and helpful hotel staff. If you are looking for a hotel in the middle of action, close to near by small restaurants etc. This is not the one. It is close to Tokyo Tower if you like to visit to see the Tokyo from birds eye view. The sound insulation is good but in night there was some street/traffic noise even though I was at 28th floor. So if you are sensitive to noise or looking for perfectly quite hotel, this may not be the one. Although I doubt there would any hotel in Tokyo without some street noise.

This is good location, walking distance to the Ginza shopping district and the fish market, and subway rides to everywhere else. The hotel is in the top floors of a business tower, and is located among other business buildings for the most part. But everything you need will be in the subway walkways if not above ground. You will walk a lot in this city, even for subways. Conveniently, this hotel is right above the Shiodome station, but it isn't a major station, so you will need to transfer when you venture out most days. The hotel itself seemed to be mostly business travelers with a good share of tourists. The staff is very polite and the service is excellent. There is a bar with city views and smoking, so you might get an occasional waft of it if that bothers you. I brought small children and we had no issues.

The hotel is located on the 25th floor of the shiodome media tower. Exiting the lift you enter a stunning atrium space. Nothing but good first impressions, although check in was very busy I was offered a seat and managed to check in within 5 minutes. Staff very polite and helpful. The room Amazing view from the room even though it was on the side facing away from mt Fuji. Very clean with a really comfortable bed. Powerful shower and a high tech Japanese toilet! Was a really nice space to come to after a days sightseeing and I loved opening up the curtains in the morning for the view. Breakfast was buffet style and was decent with good filter coffee and the usual bacon, scrambled eggs etc. Location Taking the lift down to subway level you are a 5 minute walk underground to Shinbashi station which has the Ginza line, Asakusa line and the overground JR lines with direct trains to narita airport via the narita line. To haneda airport you can walk from the hotel to Hamamatsucho station and get the monorail direct. Overall a great location for jumping on the train or metro and exploring the city. The area is mainly a business area but Shinbashi has tons of restaurants that cater for the salarymen. I had the best ramen ever at ichirin just outside the station. I would highly recommend this hotel, it seems that the hotel had 50/50 business and tourist travellers and it serves both well.

All attractions will typically be a subway ride away, but the hotel is effectively connected to the Shiodome station. The Trsukiji fish market is walking distance from the hotel. The lobby was quite nice although there were not too many places to take advantage of the view. The room was typically small for Japan, and I had a room overlooking the station. This was my first time in Tokyo, so the concept of a hotel in the middle of a skyscraper is a bit new, but kinda cool and definitely common in Japan.

That's why I gave a 4 when everything else is a 5 here. Tokyo is so big that you kind of have to pick a spot to be based at. This is good location, walking distance to the Ginza shopping district and the fish market, and subway rides to everywhere else. The hotel is in the top floors of a business tower, and is located among other business buildings for the most part. But everything you need will be in the subway walkways if not above ground. You will walk a lot in this city, even for subways. Conveniently, this hotel is right above the Shiodome station, but it isn't a major station, so you will need to transfer when you venture out most days. The hotel itself seemed to be mostly business travelers with a good share of tourists. The staff is very polite and the service is excellent. There is a bar with city views and smoking, so you might get an occasional waft of it if that bothers you. I brought small children and we had no issues. The room was predictably small but comfortable and had a nice city view. They provided a crib too. It is modern and chic with a boutique-y feel in a high rise. Great experience in Tokyo.

The hotel is located on the 25th floor of the shiodome media tower. Exiting the lift you enter a stunning atrium space. Nothing but good first impressions, although check in was very busy I was offered a seat and managed to check in within 5 minutes. Staff very polite and helpful. The room Amazing view from the room even though it was on the side facing away from mt Fuji. Very clean with a really comfortable bed. Powerful shower and a high tech Japanese toilet! Was a really nice space to come to after a days sightseeing and I loved opening up the curtains in the morning for the view. Breakfast was buffet style and was decent with good filter coffee and the usual bacon, scrambled eggs etc. Location Taking the lift down to subway level you are a 5 minute walk underground to Shinbashi station which has the Ginza line, Asakusa line and the overground JR lines with direct trains to narita airport via the narita line. To haneda airport you can walk from the hotel to Hamamatsucho station and get the monorail direct. Overall a great location for jumping on the train or metro and exploring the city. The area is mainly a business area but Shinbashi has tons of restaurants that cater for the salarymen. I had the best ramen ever at ichirin just outside the station. I would highly recommend this hotel, it seems that the hotel had 50/50 business and tourist travellers and it serves both well.

All attractions will typically be a subway ride away, but the hotel is effectively connected to the Shiodome station. The Trsukiji fish market is walking distance from the hotel. The lobby was quite nice although there were not too many places to take advantage of the view. The room was typically small for Japan, and I had a room overlooking the station. This was my first time in Tokyo, so the concept of a hotel in the middle of a skyscraper is a bit new, but kinda cool and definitely common in Japan.

That's why I gave a 4 when everything else is a 5 here. Tokyo is so big that you kind of have to pick a spot to be based at. This is good location, walking distance to the Ginza shopping district and the fish market, and subway rides to everywhere else. The hotel is in the top floors of a business tower, and is located among other business buildings for the most part. But everything you need will be in the subway walkways if not above ground. You will walk a lot in this city, even for subways. Conveniently, this hotel is right above the Shiodome station, but it isn't a major station, so you will need to transfer when you venture out most days. The hotel itself seemed to be mostly business travelers with a good share of tourists. The staff is very polite and the service is excellent. There is a bar with city views and smoking, so you might get an occasional waft of it if that bothers you. I brought small children and we had no issues. The room was predictably small but comfortable and had a nice city view. They provided a crib too. It is modern and chic with a boutique-y feel in a high rise. Great experience in Tokyo.

The hotel is located on the 25th floor of the shiodome media tower. Exiting the lift you enter a stunning atrium space. Nothing but good first impressions, although check in was very busy I was offered a seat and managed to check in within 5 minutes. Staff very polite and helpful. The room Amazing view from the room even though it was on the side facing away from mt Fuji. Very clean with a really comfortable bed. Powerful shower and a high tech Japanese toilet! Was a really nice space to come to after a days sightseeing and I loved opening up the curtains in the morning for the view. Breakfast was buffet style and was decent with good filter coffee and the usual bacon, scrambled eggs etc. Location Taking the lift down to subway level you are a 5 minute walk underground to Shinbashi station which has the Ginza line, Asakusa line and the overground JR lines with direct trains to narita airport via the narita line. To haneda airport you can walk from the hotel to Hamamatsucho station and get the monorail direct. Overall a great location for jumping on the train or metro and exploring the city. The area is mainly a business area but Shinbashi has tons of restaurants that cater for the salarymen. I had the best ramen ever at ichirin just outside the station. I would highly recommend this hotel, it seems that the hotel had 50/50 business and tourist travellers and it serves both well.

All attractions will typically be a subway ride away, but the hotel is effectively connected to the Shiodome station. The Trsukiji fish market is walking distance from the hotel. The lobby was quite nice although there were not too many places to take advantage of the view. The room was typically small for Japan, and I had a room overlooking the station. This was my first time in Tokyo, so the concept of a hotel in the middle of a skyscraper is a bit new, but kinda cool and definitely common in Japan.

That's why I gave a 4 when everything else is a 5 here. Tokyo is so big that you kind of have to pick a spot to be based at. This is good location, walking distance to the Ginza shopping district and the fish market, and subway rides to everywhere else. The hotel is in the top floors of a business tower, and is located among other business buildings for the most part. But everything you need will be in the subway walkways if not above ground. You will walk a lot in this city, even for subways. Conveniently, this hotel is right above the Shiodome station, but it isn't a major station, so you will need to transfer when you venture out most days. The hotel itself seemed to be mostly business travelers with a good share of tourists. The staff is very polite and the service is excellent. There is a bar with city views and smoking, so you might get an occasional waft of it if that bothers you. I brought small children and we had no issues. The room was predictably small but comfortable and had a nice city view. They provided a crib too. It is modern and chic with a boutique-y feel in a high rise. Great experience in Tokyo.

The hotel is located on the 25th floor of the shiodome media tower. Exiting the lift you enter a stunning atrium space. Nothing but good first impressions, although check in was very busy I was offered a seat and managed to check in within 5 minutes. Staff very polite and helpful. The room Amazing view from the room even though it was on the side facing away from mt Fuji. Very clean with a really comfortable bed. Powerful shower and a high tech Japanese toilet! Was a really nice space to come to after a days sightseeing and I loved opening up the curtains in the morning for the view. Breakfast was buffet style and was decent with good filter coffee and the usual bacon, scrambled eggs etc. Location Taking the lift down to subway level you are a 5 minute walk underground to Shinbashi station which has the Ginza line, Asakusa line and the overground JR lines with direct trains to narita airport via the narita line. To haneda airport you can walk from the hotel to Hamamatsucho station and get the monorail direct. Overall a great location for jumping on the train or metro and exploring the city. The area is mainly a business area but Shinbashi has tons of restaurants that cater for the salarymen. I had the best ramen ever at ichirin just outside the station. I would highly recommend this hotel, it seems that the hotel had 50/50 business and tourist travellers and it serves both well.

We understand it's common for wifi and breakfast to cost extra, but both came with our executive package at purchase, so ask after this option. The executive lounge has great views and amenities, but is entirely too small. It was standing room only more than once and the staff struggled to meet even basic drink orders at the bar. Breakfast in the lobby included Japanese-style and Western-style options including egg and smoothie stations. Keep in mind that this hotel asks that guests maintain a business casual dress code and conceal tattoos. Even passing through the lobby in our casual walking clothes made us seem scrubby compared to the other guests.

The housekeepers do a magnificent job. Our room was spacious and really cannot fault anything. Gym is a bit small but you do not have to pay, as long as a you can do a work out, it serves its purpose. I recommend trying out the new restaurants on the 2nd floor, you will be spoilt. Buffet breakfast can get a bit crowded on weekends but you are placed at your table quickly. Shuttle service is superb, taking you to Shinjuku station and back every 20 minutes.

I went out and came back around 6pm, there are LOTS of people waiting for lift as there were functions on 2/F... No one lines up and they just rushed into the lifts... Waited for 3 lifts to get in... Again.. Staff to smooth the traffic during that time or advise those guests to WALK to 2/F is much better as in house guests can't get into the lift at all... The cocktail hours is a disaster as well...last time I was here I didn't check the cocktail and 5 dec was the first time I went to the lounge... The lounge is all packed and the good running out fast and people are standing for drinks.. Staff at counter were busy to check in... It's not a relaxing place to sit down and drink at all... Huge disappointment..it's just like i was in a market... One last thing... I loved the quiche from my last visit at the executive lounge.

An extensive number of new hotel restaurants are now open which completes the number of dining options and choices available at the Tokyo Hilton. There is also a large shopping complex area under the hotel which leads you to the subway station. A mini-mart sells lots of food and alcoholic drink options if needed.

Size wise, it's more of a boutique hotel and the lobby tells you that. A simple driveway and two small counters for the Front Office and Concierge are all that greet hotel guests. In my case, I took advantage of their complimentary meet/greet service at Tokyo Station. This being my first visit to Tokyo, I was certainly not looking forward to the daunting task of navigating the labyrinth that is Tokyo Station. A member of the bell/concierge team met me on the platform of that my Shinkansen train came in on. Greeting me in English, I felt relieved that I would be able to communicate better with him as I have a very poor understanding of Japanese. I must commend this service as he guided me from the platform to the underground network that led to the hotel (took me a day to memorise the route but once I did, it became easy to navigate from the various train lines straight to the hotel). Upon reaching the lobby, I was usher straight to my room for the check-in. The rooms are located on the lower levels of the building, which lends to the more boutique feel. My room came with an excellent view of the Tokyo Station tracks and I could constantly observe trains moving in and out. Surprisingly, one could barely hear any noise from the tracks. The check-in formalities were completely very quickly. Not only that, but having asked the hotel for assistance with a restaurant reservation, prior to my arrival, I was presented with an envelope containing the restaurant confirmation and a fairly detailed map for the location. Furthermore, the luggage I had sent over from Kyoto was nicely placed in my room and the luggage covers removed and folded nicely in the closet. Bravo. The room itself is rather simple, a bit too simple for my liking but still comfortable. The rooms looks a little dated and could use a little sprucing up, still it was in good condition. The bed itself is very comfortable and the sleepwear equally good.One thing I have to praise is the location of the room's control panel. In most hotels, the panel is on the side table and facing outwards, meaning someone in bed has to adjust his/her body to see which buttons to press. At Four Seasons, the panel faces inwards to the bed, meaning a person in bed just has to turn left or right, very convenient. The mini-bar is rather well stocked and the fridge is big enough to store some of my own drinks. I liked that there's a full length mirror near the fairly big closet. Entertainment wise, the latest 3D TV is available, with a reasonably good selection of movies available for rent from the in-house library. Cables and international adapters were provided, again very helpful and very much what anyone would expect from major luxury chains. The bathroom is spacious enough although perhaps they should have installed a rain shower by now. The amenities are decent, soaps etc from Etro, but the simple plastic wrapping seems a bit cheap. Oddly enough, the spa/onsen amenities looked better than the ones in the room, those had proper boxes that promote the Four Seasons brand. Another issue is that the faucets did not indicate which were for hot water and which were for cold water, so it was a bit of guesswork the first time around. The handheld shower at the tub was also a bit too hot to handle when using hot water, they might wish to look into that. On the whole, minor issues aside, the location is quite unparalleled. Direct links to Tokyo Station meant being able to avoid the rain and the nearby Kyobashi Station meant I could go straight to the Ginza line easily.

The hotel was a little more lively the next morning, but still very quiet for a luxury hotel. Strangely, there are no restrooms or shops in the lobby area. Fortunately, the hotel is located over the wonderful Tokyo Station which had everything we wanted, including a Tokyu Hands store (within the Daimaru Dept store). We had outstanding service in almost every shop we walked into in Tokyo Station, and were often amused at the way waiters and shop assistants would bow repeatedly and smile and fuss over us, while speaking in Japanese! We generally had a wonderful time in the hotel, and in Tokyo. The room we stayed in deserves a full 5 stars. The lobby is just too small, however. Service too, was not up to 5 star standards. The staff were helpful and courteous, and the concierge, efficient. The young men especially, were very helpful, dashing about with umbrellas when we arrived from our trips in the rain.

Size wise, it's more of a boutique hotel and the lobby tells you that. A simple driveway and two small counters for the Front Office and Concierge are all that greet hotel guests. In my case, I took advantage of their complimentary meet/greet service at Tokyo Station. This being my first visit to Tokyo, I was certainly not looking forward to the daunting task of navigating the labyrinth that is Tokyo Station. A member of the bell/concierge team met me on the platform of that my Shinkansen train came in on. Greeting me in English, I felt relieved that I would be able to communicate better with him as I have a very poor understanding of Japanese. I must commend this service as he guided me from the platform to the underground network that led to the hotel (took me a day to memorise the route but once I did, it became easy to navigate from the various train lines straight to the hotel). Upon reaching the lobby, I was usher straight to my room for the check-in. The rooms are located on the lower levels of the building, which lends to the more boutique feel. My room came with an excellent view of the Tokyo Station tracks and I could constantly observe trains moving in and out. Surprisingly, one could barely hear any noise from the tracks. The check-in formalities were completely very quickly. Not only that, but having asked the hotel for assistance with a restaurant reservation, prior to my arrival, I was presented with an envelope containing the restaurant confirmation and a fairly detailed map for the location. Furthermore, the luggage I had sent over from Kyoto was nicely placed in my room and the luggage covers removed and folded nicely in the closet. Bravo. The room itself is rather simple, a bit too simple for my liking but still comfortable. The rooms looks a little dated and could use a little sprucing up, still it was in good condition. The bed itself is very comfortable and the sleepwear equally good.One thing I have to praise is the location of the room's control panel. In most hotels, the panel is on the side table and facing outwards, meaning someone in bed has to adjust his/her body to see which buttons to press. At Four Seasons, the panel faces inwards to the bed, meaning a person in bed just has to turn left or right, very convenient. The mini-bar is rather well stocked and the fridge is big enough to store some of my own drinks. I liked that there's a full length mirror near the fairly big closet. Entertainment wise, the latest 3D TV is available, with a reasonably good selection of movies available for rent from the in-house library. Cables and international adapters were provided, again very helpful and very much what anyone would expect from major luxury chains. The bathroom is spacious enough although perhaps they should have installed a rain shower by now. The amenities are decent, soaps etc from Etro, but the simple plastic wrapping seems a bit cheap. Oddly enough, the spa/onsen amenities looked better than the ones in the room, those had proper boxes that promote the Four Seasons brand. Another issue is that the faucets did not indicate which were for hot water and which were for cold water, so it was a bit of guesswork the first time around. The handheld shower at the tub was also a bit too hot to handle when using hot water, they might wish to look into that. On the whole, minor issues aside, the location is quite unparalleled. Direct links to Tokyo Station meant being able to avoid the rain and the nearby Kyobashi Station meant I could go straight to the Ginza line easily. The staff were also most helpful in securing me a taxi to Tsukiji at 3am in the morning as well as arranging a taxi when checking out. Another praiseworthy act was that the staff called ahead to my next hotel and provided the taxi details, so that when I arrived, I was greeted by name.

The restaurant in the hotel and all eating places nearby had closed for the night. We had to dash across the road in heavy rain, to a nearby convenience store (Lawson), for some sandwiches. I had previously communicated with the hotel several times via e-mail regarding my visit, and it would have been good if they had told me regarding the lack of dining options at the tentative time of my arrival. The hotel was a little more lively the next morning, but still very quiet for a luxury hotel. Strangely, there are no restrooms or shops in the lobby area. Fortunately, the hotel is located over the wonderful Tokyo Station which had everything we wanted, including a Tokyu Hands store (within the Daimaru Dept store). We had outstanding service in almost every shop we walked into in Tokyo Station, and were often amused at the way waiters and shop assistants would bow repeatedly and smile and fuss over us, while speaking in Japanese! We generally had a wonderful time in the hotel, and in Tokyo. The room we stayed in deserves a full 5 stars. The lobby is just too small, however. Service too, was not up to 5 star standards. The staff were helpful and courteous, and the concierge, efficient. The young men especially, were very helpful, dashing about with umbrellas when we arrived from our trips in the rain.

Size wise, it's more of a boutique hotel and the lobby tells you that. A simple driveway and two small counters for the Front Office and Concierge are all that greet hotel guests. In my case, I took advantage of their complimentary meet/greet service at Tokyo Station. This being my first visit to Tokyo, I was certainly not looking forward to the daunting task of navigating the labyrinth that is Tokyo Station. A member of the bell/concierge team met me on the platform of that my Shinkansen train came in on. Greeting me in English, I felt relieved that I would be able to communicate better with him as I have a very poor understanding of Japanese. I must commend this service as he guided me from the platform to the underground network that led to the hotel (took me a day to memorise the route but once I did, it became easy to navigate from the various train lines straight to the hotel). Upon reaching the lobby, I was usher straight to my room for the check-in. The rooms are located on the lower levels of the building, which lends to the more boutique feel. My room came with an excellent view of the Tokyo Station tracks and I could constantly observe trains moving in and out. Surprisingly, one could barely hear any noise from the tracks. The check-in formalities were completely very quickly. Not only that, but having asked the hotel for assistance with a restaurant reservation, prior to my arrival, I was presented with an envelope containing the restaurant confirmation and a fairly detailed map for the location. Furthermore, the luggage I had sent over from Kyoto was nicely placed in my room and the luggage covers removed and folded nicely in the closet. Bravo. The room itself is rather simple, a bit too simple for my liking but still comfortable. The rooms looks a little dated and could use a little sprucing up, still it was in good condition. The bed itself is very comfortable and the sleepwear equally good.One thing I have to praise is the location of the room's control panel. In most hotels, the panel is on the side table and facing outwards, meaning someone in bed has to adjust his/her body to see which buttons to press. At Four Seasons, the panel faces inwards to the bed, meaning a person in bed just has to turn left or right, very convenient. The mini-bar is rather well stocked and the fridge is big enough to store some of my own drinks. I liked that there's a full length mirror near the fairly big closet. Entertainment wise, the latest 3D TV is available, with a reasonably good selection of movies available for rent from the in-house library. Cables and international adapters were provided, again very helpful and very much what anyone would expect from major luxury chains. The bathroom is spacious enough although perhaps they should have installed a rain shower by now. The amenities are decent, soaps etc from Etro, but the simple plastic wrapping seems a bit cheap. Oddly enough, the spa/onsen amenities looked better than the ones in the room, those had proper boxes that promote the Four Seasons brand. Another issue is that the faucets did not indicate which were for hot water and which were for cold water, so it was a bit of guesswork the first time around. The handheld shower at the tub was also a bit too hot to handle when using hot water, they might wish to look into that. On the whole, minor issues aside, the location is quite unparalleled.

The hotel has 3 towers. I stayed in Tower 3 so I can only speak to that one, but its condition is somewhat shabby. The room furnishings are standard Hilton stuff, but the lighting in the room was completely lacking, as were the bathroom amenities -- no shower gel and no mouthwash, both of which I am accustomed to seeing as a Hilton Gold member staying on a \"HHonors\" floor. Also the rooms have really small windows -- my room had a large exterior-facing wall, that would have made for a wonderful large extended window, and instead the tower built these rooms with 2 tiny windows, spread far apart. The room therefore got no natural light, and not enough electric light, so everything was just DARK. At check-in, the agent told me what a wonderful room I had. It was on the 18th floor and this is a top floor of the 3rd tower, but the other towers have 40+ floors and my window actually looked straight into the rooms of the other tower, so not much privacy for either of us, and this necessitated the privacy curtain which only made the lack of light even worse. The elevators are very shabby, quirky, barely work, with dated 1980s decor. Parking - a PLUS actually. The garage is attached to tower 3, so if you are self parking, it is very advantageous to stay in tower 3, you will be able to get to your car somewhat easily. The configuration of the garage is BIZARRE -- the tightest turns imaginable, the worst possible use of space, and a lot of the garage area I noticed was used for storage of catering tableware. (I wouldn't want to eat here for a conference, that's for damn sure, if the dishes are left out in the open, in the parking garage.) But considering that most hotels in the downtown area do not even have self-parking in the same building, I will still consider this hotel's parking situation to be a PLUS. It is much more convenient that waiting for a valet. (If you are staying in one of the other towers, you will have to shlep all the way downstairs then walk over to the tower 3 elevators and go back up.) Check-in and the lobby areas are a total zoo. Hundreds of people milling around, many of them seemingly just for the free internet. Lines for everything. Nothing is fast or calm or pleasing about the energy of this place. Hhonors breakfast amenity - the WORST of any Hilton I've stayed in. They give you 2 options, a \"continental breakfast\" from the lobby Starbucks, which includes a drink, a piece of fruit, and a pastry (but NOT a 'breakfast sandwich'). This is as stingy as you can imagine. OR, you can go to the restaurant and they give you a $10 dining credit. I chose the buffet, which is regularly priced at $29.99, and the food was DISGUSTING. The scrambled eggs were poorly cooked, overloaded with butter or oil, and just tasted like crap. They had \"steam salmon\" which looked like a good clean protein item, but the salmon smelled very fishy (that is, not fresh, at all) and otherwise was completely bland and without any spice or taste. Meh. The layout of this entire place is strange - from the towers to the restaurant. The restaurant is really like 4 rooms in one. Seems like a hodgepodge of decades of poorly conceived, incohesive cheap remodels, where they kept cutting and pasting the structure to death. What really annoyed me the most was the breakfast. Hilton's brand promises a legitimate, full, FREE breakfast for Golds. This properly simply does not offer one. If you are a frequent business traveler and actually have some (a) fashion sense, and (b) expectation of a comfortable, stylish ambience.....this place is NOT for you. It is a zoo. A zoo full of conventioneers. Boring, blah conventioneers from the flyover states.

The hotel has 3 towers. I stayed in Tower 3 so I can only speak to that one, but its condition is somewhat shabby. The room furnishings are standard Hilton stuff, but the lighting in the room was completely lacking, as were the bathroom amenities -- no shower gel and no mouthwash, both of which I am accustomed to seeing as a Hilton Gold member staying on a \"HHonors\" floor. Also the rooms have really small windows -- my room had a large exterior-facing wall, that would have made for a wonderful large extended window, and instead the tower built these rooms with 2 tiny windows, spread far apart. The room therefore got no natural light, and not enough electric light, so everything was just DARK. At check-in, the agent told me what a wonderful room I had. It was on the 18th floor and this is a top floor of the 3rd tower, but the other towers have 40+ floors and my window actually looked straight into the rooms of the other tower, so not much privacy for either of us, and this necessitated the privacy curtain which only made the lack of light even worse. The elevators are very shabby, quirky, barely work, with dated 1980s decor. Parking - a PLUS actually. The garage is attached to tower 3, so if you are self parking, it is very advantageous to stay in tower 3, you will be able to get to your car somewhat easily. The configuration of the garage is BIZARRE -- the tightest turns imaginable, the worst possible use of space, and a lot of the garage area I noticed was used for storage of catering tableware. (I wouldn't want to eat here for a conference, that's for damn sure, if the dishes are left out in the open, in the parking garage.) But considering that most hotels in the downtown area do not even have self-parking in the same building, I will still consider this hotel's parking situation to be a PLUS. It is much more convenient that waiting for a valet. (If you are staying in one of the other towers, you will have to shlep all the way downstairs then walk over to the tower 3 elevators and go back up.) Check-in and the lobby areas are a total zoo. Hundreds of people milling around, many of them seemingly just for the free internet. Lines for everything. Nothing is fast or calm or pleasing about the energy of this place. Hhonors breakfast amenity - the WORST of any Hilton I've stayed in. They give you 2 options, a \"continental breakfast\" from the lobby Starbucks, which includes a drink, a piece of fruit, and a pastry (but NOT a 'breakfast sandwich'). This is as stingy as you can imagine. OR, you can go to the restaurant and they give you a $10 dining credit. I chose the buffet, which is regularly priced at $29.99, and the food was DISGUSTING. The scrambled eggs were poorly cooked, overloaded with butter or oil, and just tasted like crap. They had \"steam salmon\" which looked like a good clean protein item, but the salmon smelled very fishy (that is, not fresh, at all) and otherwise was completely bland and without any spice or taste. Meh. The layout of this entire place is strange - from the towers to the restaurant. The restaurant is really like 4 rooms in one. Seems like a hodgepodge of decades of poorly conceived, incohesive cheap remodels, where they kept cutting and pasting the structure to death. What really annoyed me the most was the breakfast. Hilton's brand promises a legitimate, full, FREE breakfast for Golds. This properly simply does not offer one. If you are a frequent business traveler and actually have some (a) fashion sense, and (b) expectation of a comfortable, stylish ambience.....this place is NOT for you. It is a zoo.

The hotel has 3 towers. I stayed in Tower 3 so I can only speak to that one, but its condition is somewhat shabby. The room furnishings are standard Hilton stuff, but the lighting in the room was completely lacking, as were the bathroom amenities -- no shower gel and no mouthwash, both of which I am accustomed to seeing as a Hilton Gold member staying on a \"HHonors\" floor. Also the rooms have really small windows -- my room had a large exterior-facing wall, that would have made for a wonderful large extended window, and instead the tower built these rooms with 2 tiny windows, spread far apart. The room therefore got no natural light, and not enough electric light, so everything was just DARK. At check-in, the agent told me what a wonderful room I had. It was on the 18th floor and this is a top floor of the 3rd tower, but the other towers have 40+ floors and my window actually looked straight into the rooms of the other tower, so not much privacy for either of us, and this necessitated the privacy curtain which only made the lack of light even worse. The elevators are very shabby, quirky, barely work, with dated 1980s decor. Parking - a PLUS actually. The garage is attached to tower 3, so if you are self parking, it is very advantageous to stay in tower 3, you will be able to get to your car somewhat easily. The configuration of the garage is BIZARRE -- the tightest turns imaginable, the worst possible use of space, and a lot of the garage area I noticed was used for storage of catering tableware. (I wouldn't want to eat here for a conference, that's for damn sure, if the dishes are left out in the open, in the parking garage.) But considering that most hotels in the downtown area do not even have self-parking in the same building, I will still consider this hotel's parking situation to be a PLUS. It is much more convenient that waiting for a valet. (If you are staying in one of the other towers, you will have to shlep all the way downstairs then walk over to the tower 3 elevators and go back up.) Check-in and the lobby areas are a total zoo. Hundreds of people milling around, many of them seemingly just for the free internet. Lines for everything. Nothing is fast or calm or pleasing about the energy of this place. Hhonors breakfast amenity - the WORST of any Hilton I've stayed in. They give you 2 options, a \"continental breakfast\" from the lobby Starbucks, which includes a drink, a piece of fruit, and a pastry (but NOT a 'breakfast sandwich'). This is as stingy as you can imagine. OR, you can go to the restaurant and they give you a $10 dining credit. I chose the buffet, which is regularly priced at $29.99, and the food was DISGUSTING. The scrambled eggs were poorly cooked, overloaded with butter or oil, and just tasted like crap. They had \"steam salmon\" which looked like a good clean protein item, but the salmon smelled very fishy (that is, not fresh, at all) and otherwise was completely bland and without any spice or taste. Meh. The layout of this entire place is strange - from the towers to the restaurant. The restaurant is really like 4 rooms in one. Seems like a hodgepodge of decades of poorly conceived, incohesive cheap remodels, where they kept cutting and pasting the structure to death. What really annoyed me the most was the breakfast. Hilton's brand promises a legitimate, full, FREE breakfast for Golds. This properly simply does not offer one. If you are a frequent business traveler and actually have some (a) fashion sense, and (b) expectation of a comfortable, stylish ambience.....this place is NOT for you. It is a zoo. A zoo full of conventioneers. Boring, blah conventioneers from the flyover states.

The staff were also professional and provided good service. The location is also in a good, central, nice part of SF, although it is on Knob Hill, a VERY big, steep hill. Geography isn't their fault, and it affords some nice views, but can be a consideration if you plan on walking much. The room rate wasn't bad for the SF market. However, what got to me was the constant barrage of trying to nickle and dime me for extras during my stay. Bringing a car? Hope you don't mind adding an extra $54/night to your cost (Unless you were smart enough to find the special rate with parking included on the website) Want to use the Internet? That'll be extra. Want to use the gym? That'll be extra too. Want to have breakfast in the hotel? That'll be a $30 eggs benedict. Want to store something in the minifridge? Sorry, it's completely full and everything in the dresser is boobytrapped to charge you extra as soon as you touch it. How much is all that? Sorry there's no price list anywhere. At least the shower soap was free. I understand they're not targeting the budget traveler market, but this is getting into fleecing glib, never been to a grocery store oligarch territory here.

At the check in desk, the experience was also very pleasant. I received a corner room with great views of the city, China Town and the Bay Bridge. In order to get Wi-Fi in the room, a purchase is required or membership in the Fairmont President's Club. I called for assistance and was directed to the front desk for help. Instructions were not clear and resulted in me charging to credit card the fee and instead of The Fairmont being able to revers the charge, I had to go to my credit card issuer to dispute the charge. I recommend guests be sure to find the link to charge the fee to the room or sign-up for the Fairmont President's Club prior to checking in. This hiccup aside, my experience was great and I find this luxury hotel worthy of my repeat business.

This hotel has a great feel and we enjoyed our stay there. The location is excellent, cabs are easy to get, or you can walk to many of the tourist destinations. The building is a historic landmark and our room was really nice with a great view of the city. The bathroom looked like it had been recently renovated and looked excellent. The concierge desk at this hotel is well staffed with very professional, knowledgeable, and helpful people. We have never had anything go wrong at a Fairmont and the cleanliness seems to be pretty good. The thing that stops me from giving this hotel the highest rating is their insistence on using their wifi as a cheap profit-making cash-grab. A Motel 6 will give you free wifi; but, at the Fairmont, (I noticed it in Seattle a few months ago as well) it seems free, but when you go to log in you have to agree to pay $15.00 a day for it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit over the top and slightly hard to take. I might stay in another hotel chain that has free wifi a few times just to avoid feeling as though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being pick-pocketed.

At the check in desk, the experience was also very pleasant. I received a corner room with great views of the city, China Town and the Bay Bridge. In order to get Wi-Fi in the room, a purchase is required or membership in the Fairmont President's Club. I called for assistance and was directed to the front desk for help. Instructions were not clear and resulted in me charging to credit card the fee and instead of The Fairmont being able to revers the charge, I had to go to my credit card issuer to dispute the charge. I recommend guests be sure to find the link to charge the fee to the room or sign-up for the Fairmont President's Club prior to checking in. This hiccup aside, my experience was great and I find this luxury hotel worthy of my repeat business.

This hotel has a great feel and we enjoyed our stay there. The location is excellent, cabs are easy to get, or you can walk to many of the tourist destinations. The building is a historic landmark and our room was really nice with a great view of the city. The bathroom looked like it had been recently renovated and looked excellent. The concierge desk at this hotel is well staffed with very professional, knowledgeable, and helpful people. We have never had anything go wrong at a Fairmont and the cleanliness seems to be pretty good. The thing that stops me from giving this hotel the highest rating is their insistence on using their wifi as a cheap profit-making cash-grab. A Motel 6 will give you free wifi; but, at the Fairmont, (I noticed it in Seattle a few months ago as well) it seems free, but when you go to log in you have to agree to pay $15.00 a day for it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit over the top and slightly hard to take. I might stay in another hotel chain that has free wifi a few times just to avoid feeling as though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being pick-pocketed.

Geography isn't their fault, and it affords some nice views, but can be a consideration if you plan on walking much. The room rate wasn't bad for the SF market. However, what got to me was the constant barrage of trying to nickle and dime me for extras during my stay. Bringing a car? Hope you don't mind adding an extra $54/night to your cost (Unless you were smart enough to find the special rate with parking included on the website) Want to use the Internet? That'll be extra. Want to use the gym? That'll be extra too. Want to have breakfast in the hotel? That'll be a $30 eggs benedict. Want to store something in the minifridge? Sorry, it's completely full and everything in the dresser is boobytrapped to charge you extra as soon as you touch it. How much is all that? Sorry there's no price list anywhere.

I guess over the years I've become accustomed to nicer hotels having a restaurant. I'll usually only dine at the hotel restaurant once or twice, but it can be convenient, and it can be a nice spot to grab a drink after running around touring. The Drisco is located in a residential-only area, so you need to walk 10-15 minutes to get to any dining establishments. The residential area surrounding the Drisco is rather stunning. The homes are those of very wealthy people, and this makes for a nice neighborhood walk. Nonetheless, being in a residential area is a little inconvenient. Everything else is top notch. Great, helpful, friendly staff. Comfortable, attractive rooms with good city views (assuming you have a city view room!). Comfy bed with option to order different pillows. Small comment on the bikes you can borrow from the hotel: my wife's bike kept changing gears on her, and the storage basket kept flopping around, causing balance problems. They are meant to be the kind of bike nobody wants to steal - but, they could still use a little better upkeep. Also, for me personally, I found SF city streets to be very scary! Most city streets don't have a bike lane, so local bikers will just ride along the right side of the road where the cars are parked. What??? That seems crazy, any one of those cars might open the driver side door and...whack! Unless you know the safest biking areas, I do not recommend casual biking as a tourist. This, of course, is not a comment on the hotel at all, just a general SF comment.", "Sleep Quality": "4 of 5 stars", "Place": "boulder", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/c8/71/d4/boulderkc.jpg", "Date": "24 November 2014", "management_response": "DriscoManager, General Manager at Hotel Drisco, responded to this review, 1 week ago Dear Guest, You're correct, we don't have a restaurant at the Hotel Drisco, but as of last year we do offer 24 hour room service.

We spent seven nights at this hotel and the entire stay became the best part of our San Francisco experience. Although the hotel is not located near some of the main attractions, the staff was very helpful in explaining the MUNI transportation which was 29.00 for the entire week (and included rides on the cable cars). Also, a town car was available during the week to drop us off at Union Square in the morning. The hotel offers a great complimentary breakfast with all sorts of breads, pastries, cereals, oatmeal, cappucinos, juices, etc. In addition, at night the hotel has cheeses, wine, meatballs, and fruit. One night we were so tired that we actually skipped dinner and ate at their wine reception instead. Also, the concierge called us 1 week prior to check-in to confirm our stay and to see if we wanted to make arrangements for anything. She booked a reservation at a nearby restaurant which was very good (Food Inc.) and had live music on Friday night. We had a city view suite which was rather large and the bed was super comfortable. We borrowed DVDs from their video library and relaxed our aching feet at night. We were there for my birthday and they treated me very well. We received fruit in our room on the first night (because it was a suite) and a bottle of wine for my birthday. It made me feel very special. This hotel goes above and beyond any hotel I've ever stayed at. They provide robes and slippers and have turn down service which includes delivery of chocolate cookies at night. They also provide complimentary bottled water in the room. The hotel is located in the very nice Pacific Heights neighborhood and is a peaceful oasis away from all of the hustle and bustle of the city. Everyone at this hotel was extremely pleasant and we enjoyed every minute of our stay. We were extremely happy with our decision to stay here and if we ever go back to San Francisco this will be our only choice. Room Tip: City view suite was awesome!

Sometimes you can be disappointed - but with this one we definitely were not.Everything was beautifully presented, the room was very comfortable and had plenty of style. As the hotel was built in the early 1900's it does not feature \"up-to-the-minute\" bathrooms but ours was very nice, clean and had all the trimmings - in fact it was quite luxurious. The complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, and early evening wine and cheese tasting were all excellent with good quality ingredients - as were the in-room meals. There was just a small in room menu but all items were delicious. There were so many complimentary things (breakfast, coffee & tea in the lounge, afternoon tea, wine & cheese tasting in the evenings, car services) which makes guests feel totally comfortable.

The last time we were in SF, we stayed at the Ritz and it was a MAJOR disappointment. This time, I wanted a different experience, neighborhood, and vibe, so I went out on a limb and booked the Hotel Drisco. Simply amazing from check-in to check-out! Where to begin? How about our taxi driving into the beautiful Pacific Heights neighborhood, cresting a steep hill, and pulling up to the lovely Hotel Drisco? Impressed by the pristine, charming exterior, we entered the cozy foyer and were further impressed by the warm welcome (and towels!) we received by the staff. We were offered a room upgrade for a nominal fee and were taken to see the room we'd reserved as well as the upgraded suite so that we could make an informed decision. The lower level room we'd originally chosen was charming, but the suite on the second floor was amazing. No brainer there. Upgrade! As we checked in, were were told about the hotels many amenities - complimentary wine tasting in the evenings, complimentary breakfast, complimentary bicycles, complimentary movies (although, unless I missed it, I didn't see \"So I Married an Ax Murderer\" in the San Francisco section - it should definitely be added!), complimentary wifi, complimentary...you get the picture! It is clear the Hotel Drisco's priority isn't making as much extra money off its guests as possible, nay they give so much to their guests, it's a wonder they are MAKING any money at all! Once we were settled into our beautiful, elegantly appointed room, we took a moment to check out the beautiful views from our windows. There is no A/C, which was fine with us. The breezes and city sounds coming through the open windows were splendid. I will note here that I read in previous reviews that the open windows could present a problem because of sounds from other rooms. One evening, we were privy to the late night \"intimacies\" of the guests above us. Meh. Get over it. This sometimes happens in a hotel, with our without open windows. The hotel staff was incredible. Everyone smiling, gracious, friendly. There wasn't one person who behaved as if they didn't enjoy their job, from the gentleman that gave us our bike, to the bellmen, to the restaurant staff (Amati *spelling?* was a particular delight!). Don't miss the ample, delicious buffet breakfast, and definitely don't miss the wine tasting. The latter was less \"tasting,\" more \"have as many glasses of GOOD wine as you want...on us!\" Again, this hotel could be up charging all over the place and yet they don't. Staying here is like being a guest in the home of a very good friend, aesthetically and hospitality-wise. Hotel Drisco, you've got this hotel thing down. Please don't ever change! Last thing I'll note is that the hotel isn't located super close to the touristy stuff (Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, etc.). This was part of the reason we selected it. Nestled in Pac Heights, it's walking distance to the Lyon Street Steps, Fillmore Street, the Presidio, and other less crowded attractions.

The Hotel Drisco is perfect for peace and quiet close to Billionaires Row. The hotel is located on top of a very very steep hill in Pacific Heights. It is on a street of ten million dollar homes, a block from homes that are tens of millions of dollars. It is the only commercial building in a residential neighborhood. Our room was on the ground floor but due to the steepness of the street, once back to our room (at the back of the hotel) we were 3 stories up! And as the hotel is at the top of the hill, the views are as if you are 25 stories high looking down on a sweeping view of the city. The upside of the hotel is that it is far from the maddening crowds- no bums, no craziness (which is also its downside). The hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to the most visited parts of town. We took it to Union square. The hotel staff is extremely friendly. Most guests seemed to be European. There is a lounge with biscottis. In the morning breakfast is complementary- a European style buffet, much nicer than a Residence Inn type buffet, with good smoked salmon, croissants, fruits, fresh juice, cereals etc. From 5 to 6:30 each day there is a wine and hor's d'oeurves reception with a nice selection of wines, cheeses, hummus, nuts, etc. In the evening there are fresh cookies bought to your room. The rooms are upscale with Ipod docking station, noise machine for sleeping and nice toiletries. Our suite had a large living room, nice sized bedroom with desk and large flat screen tv's. As the hotel was built before the 1906 earthquake, the bathrooms are small with only one sink and a tub shower with a curtain- haven't had one of those in 20 years. Also, there is no A/C. This was not a problem as the temps were in the 50's and low 60's in the evening, this being San Fran. We had the windows open at night and as we were in a residential neighborhood, even though it was the weekend, it was absolutely peaceful and quiet all evening long. One issue was the bed. Although the pillows were comfortable, I have a bad back and the bed was horrible for my back. I woke up each morning in lots of pain. My wife found the bed just fine, not having any back issues herself. Another quirk is that there is no parking or valet- however, being a residential neighborhood, parking was easy and ample. Restaurants were walking distance, but one had to navigate up/down the hills. Other than the bed, this is an interesting choice if you are sick of the large hotels on Nob Hill or in Union Square.

This small hotel differentiates itself by its high service values, which it does very well. The hotel is located on a corner in Pacific Heights ideally located to get into the city easily. It has a small, intimate feel, which is reflected in the personal, customer-orientated approach of the staff. Other reviewers have commented on the free afternoon tea, early evening cheese and wine tasting, complementary breakfast - they are all united by being excellent. And the simple free WiFi - just turn on and that's it, no need to register. Oh that other hotels would learn from this. The staff are great too, whether front of house, breakfast service or room service. They are all pleasant and very helpful. I particularly want to thank Bob on reception for his help and advice, and the operations manager, Victor, whom I bombarded with email requests for restaurant bookings before we arrived to ensure the arrangements were perfect for celebrating my wife's 'significant' birthday when we were there. And a thank you to Julio who drive me round for three hours on a very busy afternoon (the air show was on so traffic was clogging the city) helping me get the perfect photo of the Golden Gate Bridge during continually shifting weather. He was aware that it wasn't working out so well because of the traffic and weather so he gave me some extra time for free so I could leave with that 'perfect shot.' This is not an impersonal big chain hotel so if you like anonymity don't come here. The Drisco know they're not a big hotel but more importantly they know how to successfully differentiate themselves in the highly competitive hotel market of SF so that people like me and many others will want to return. And hopefully we will. I can do nothing more than say if you're going to SF for work or leisure then stay here because you will absolutely not be disappointed.", "Sleep Quality": "5 of 5 stars", "Place": "NW England", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/56/avatar029.jpg", "Date": "no-date", "management_response": "", "Badges": "61 reviews 26 hotel reviews Reviews in 44 cities 46 helpful votes", "Location": "5 of 5 stars"}, {"rating": "5 of 5 stars", "room_tip": "Room Tip Choose bay side rooms for a view..

I guess over the years I've become accustomed to nicer hotels having a restaurant. I'll usually only dine at the hotel restaurant once or twice, but it can be convenient, and it can be a nice spot to grab a drink after running around touring. The Drisco is located in a residential-only area, so you need to walk 10-15 minutes to get to any dining establishments. The residential area surrounding the Drisco is rather stunning. The homes are those of very wealthy people, and this makes for a nice neighborhood walk. Nonetheless, being in a residential area is a little inconvenient. Everything else is top notch. Great, helpful, friendly staff. Comfortable, attractive rooms with good city views (assuming you have a city view room!). Comfy bed with option to order different pillows. Small comment on the bikes you can borrow from the hotel: my wife's bike kept changing gears on her, and the storage basket kept flopping around, causing balance problems. They are meant to be the kind of bike nobody wants to steal - but, they could still use a little better upkeep. Also, for me personally, I found SF city streets to be very scary! Most city streets don't have a bike lane, so local bikers will just ride along the right side of the road where the cars are parked. What??? That seems crazy, any one of those cars might open the driver side door and...whack! Unless you know the safest biking areas, I do not recommend casual biking as a tourist. This, of course, is not a comment on the hotel at all, just a general SF comment.", "Sleep Quality": "4 of 5 stars", "Place": "boulder", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/c8/71/d4/boulderkc.jpg", "Date": "24 November 2014", "management_response": "DriscoManager, General Manager at Hotel Drisco, responded to this review, 1 week ago Dear Guest, You're correct, we don't have a restaurant at the Hotel Drisco, but as of last year we do offer 24 hour room service.

We spent seven nights at this hotel and the entire stay became the best part of our San Francisco experience. Although the hotel is not located near some of the main attractions, the staff was very helpful in explaining the MUNI transportation which was 29.00 for the entire week (and included rides on the cable cars). Also, a town car was available during the week to drop us off at Union Square in the morning. The hotel offers a great complimentary breakfast with all sorts of breads, pastries, cereals, oatmeal, cappucinos, juices, etc. In addition, at night the hotel has cheeses, wine, meatballs, and fruit. One night we were so tired that we actually skipped dinner and ate at their wine reception instead. Also, the concierge called us 1 week prior to check-in to confirm our stay and to see if we wanted to make arrangements for anything. She booked a reservation at a nearby restaurant which was very good (Food Inc.) and had live music on Friday night. We had a city view suite which was rather large and the bed was super comfortable. We borrowed DVDs from their video library and relaxed our aching feet at night. We were there for my birthday and they treated me very well. We received fruit in our room on the first night (because it was a suite) and a bottle of wine for my birthday. It made me feel very special. This hotel goes above and beyond any hotel I've ever stayed at. They provide robes and slippers and have turn down service which includes delivery of chocolate cookies at night. They also provide complimentary bottled water in the room. The hotel is located in the very nice Pacific Heights neighborhood and is a peaceful oasis away from all of the hustle and bustle of the city. Everyone at this hotel was extremely pleasant and we enjoyed every minute of our stay.

This time, I wanted a different experience, neighborhood, and vibe, so I went out on a limb and booked the Hotel Drisco. Simply amazing from check-in to check-out! Where to begin? How about our taxi driving into the beautiful Pacific Heights neighborhood, cresting a steep hill, and pulling up to the lovely Hotel Drisco? Impressed by the pristine, charming exterior, we entered the cozy foyer and were further impressed by the warm welcome (and towels!) we received by the staff. We were offered a room upgrade for a nominal fee and were taken to see the room we'd reserved as well as the upgraded suite so that we could make an informed decision. The lower level room we'd originally chosen was charming, but the suite on the second floor was amazing. No brainer there. Upgrade! As we checked in, were were told about the hotels many amenities - complimentary wine tasting in the evenings, complimentary breakfast, complimentary bicycles, complimentary movies (although, unless I missed it, I didn't see \"So I Married an Ax Murderer\" in the San Francisco section - it should definitely be added!), complimentary wifi, complimentary...you get the picture! It is clear the Hotel Drisco's priority isn't making as much extra money off its guests as possible, nay they give so much to their guests, it's a wonder they are MAKING any money at all! Once we were settled into our beautiful, elegantly appointed room, we took a moment to check out the beautiful views from our windows. There is no A/C, which was fine with us. The breezes and city sounds coming through the open windows were splendid. I will note here that I read in previous reviews that the open windows could present a problem because of sounds from other rooms. One evening, we were privy to the late night \"intimacies\" of the guests above us. Meh. Get over it. This sometimes happens in a hotel, with our without open windows. The hotel staff was incredible. Everyone smiling, gracious, friendly. There wasn't one person who behaved as if they didn't enjoy their job, from the gentleman that gave us our bike, to the bellmen, to the restaurant staff (Amati *spelling?* was a particular delight!). Don't miss the ample, delicious buffet breakfast, and definitely don't miss the wine tasting. The latter was less \"tasting,\" more \"have as many glasses of GOOD wine as you want...on us!\" Again, this hotel could be up charging all over the place and yet they don't. Staying here is like being a guest in the home of a very good friend, aesthetically and hospitality-wise. Hotel Drisco, you've got this hotel thing down. Please don't ever change! Last thing I'll note is that the hotel isn't located super close to the touristy stuff (Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, etc.). This was part of the reason we selected it. Nestled in Pac Heights, it's walking distance to the Lyon Street Steps, Fillmore Street, the Presidio, and other less crowded attractions. The Golden Gate Bridge is close by bike or if you're a runner like me and want to run there and back. I just can't say enough about this hotel. It's no surprise they are the #1 San Francisco hotel on Trip Advisor! Excellent job, Hotel Drisco! Again, PLEASE don't change! We'll be back very soon!", "Place": "", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/04/30/f2/20/joi-m.jpg", "Date": "3 November 2014", "management_response": "DriscoManager, General Manager at Hotel Drisco, responded to this review, 1 week ago Dear Guest, You began your review with a query about where to start, and I'll begin my response with the same query -- where to begin?

The Hotel Drisco is perfect for peace and quiet close to Billionaires Row. The hotel is located on top of a very very steep hill in Pacific Heights. It is on a street of ten million dollar homes, a block from homes that are tens of millions of dollars. It is the only commercial building in a residential neighborhood. Our room was on the ground floor but due to the steepness of the street, once back to our room (at the back of the hotel) we were 3 stories up! And as the hotel is at the top of the hill, the views are as if you are 25 stories high looking down on a sweeping view of the city. The upside of the hotel is that it is far from the maddening crowds- no bums, no craziness (which is also its downside). The hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to the most visited parts of town. We took it to Union square. The hotel staff is extremely friendly. Most guests seemed to be European. There is a lounge with biscottis. In the morning breakfast is complementary- a European style buffet, much nicer than a Residence Inn type buffet, with good smoked salmon, croissants, fruits, fresh juice, cereals etc. From 5 to 6:30 each day there is a wine and hor's d'oeurves reception with a nice selection of wines, cheeses, hummus, nuts, etc. In the evening there are fresh cookies bought to your room. The rooms are upscale with Ipod docking station, noise machine for sleeping and nice toiletries. Our suite had a large living room, nice sized bedroom with desk and large flat screen tv's. As the hotel was built before the 1906 earthquake, the bathrooms are small with only one sink and a tub shower with a curtain- haven't had one of those in 20 years. Also, there is no A/C. This was not a problem as the temps were in the 50's and low 60's in the evening, this being San Fran. We had the windows open at night and as we were in a residential neighborhood, even though it was the weekend, it was absolutely peaceful and quiet all evening long. One issue was the bed. Although the pillows were comfortable, I have a bad back and the bed was horrible for my back. I woke up each morning in lots of pain. My wife found the bed just fine, not having any back issues herself. Another quirk is that there is no parking or valet- however, being a residential neighborhood, parking was easy and ample. Restaurants were walking distance, but one had to navigate up/down the hills. Other than the bed, this is an interesting choice if you are sick of the large hotels on Nob Hill or in Union Square.

This small hotel differentiates itself by its high service values, which it does very well. The hotel is located on a corner in Pacific Heights ideally located to get into the city easily. It has a small, intimate feel, which is reflected in the personal, customer-orientated approach of the staff. Other reviewers have commented on the free afternoon tea, early evening cheese and wine tasting, complementary breakfast - they are all united by being excellent. And the simple free WiFi - just turn on and that's it, no need to register. Oh that other hotels would learn from this. The staff are great too, whether front of house, breakfast service or room service. They are all pleasant and very helpful. I particularly want to thank Bob on reception for his help and advice, and the operations manager, Victor, whom I bombarded with email requests for restaurant bookings before we arrived to ensure the arrangements were perfect for celebrating my wife's 'significant' birthday when we were there. And a thank you to Julio who drive me round for three hours on a very busy afternoon (the air show was on so traffic was clogging the city) helping me get the perfect photo of the Golden Gate Bridge during continually shifting weather. He was aware that it wasn't working out so well because of the traffic and weather so he gave me some extra time for free so I could leave with that 'perfect shot.' This is not an impersonal big chain hotel so if you like anonymity don't come here. The Drisco know they're not a big hotel but more importantly they know how to successfully differentiate themselves in the highly competitive hotel market of SF so that people like me and many others will want to return. And hopefully we will. I can do nothing more than say if you're going to SF for work or leisure then stay here because you will absolutely not be disappointed.", "Sleep Quality": "5 of 5 stars", "Place": "NW England", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/56/avatar029.jpg", "Date": "no-date", "management_response": "", "Badges": "61 reviews 26 hotel reviews Reviews in 44 cities 46 helpful votes", "Location": "5 of 5 stars"}, {"rating": "5 of 5 stars", "room_tip": "Room Tip Choose bay side rooms for a view..

I guess over the years I've become accustomed to nicer hotels having a restaurant. I'll usually only dine at the hotel restaurant once or twice, but it can be convenient, and it can be a nice spot to grab a drink after running around touring. The Drisco is located in a residential-only area, so you need to walk 10-15 minutes to get to any dining establishments. The residential area surrounding the Drisco is rather stunning. The homes are those of very wealthy people, and this makes for a nice neighborhood walk. Nonetheless, being in a residential area is a little inconvenient. Everything else is top notch. Great, helpful, friendly staff. Comfortable, attractive rooms with good city views (assuming you have a city view room!). Comfy bed with option to order different pillows. Small comment on the bikes you can borrow from the hotel: my wife's bike kept changing gears on her, and the storage basket kept flopping around, causing balance problems. They are meant to be the kind of bike nobody wants to steal - but, they could still use a little better upkeep. Also, for me personally, I found SF city streets to be very scary! Most city streets don't have a bike lane, so local bikers will just ride along the right side of the road where the cars are parked. What??? That seems crazy, any one of those cars might open the driver side door and...whack! Unless you know the safest biking areas, I do not recommend casual biking as a tourist. This, of course, is not a comment on the hotel at all, just a general SF comment.", "Sleep Quality": "4 of 5 stars", "Place": "boulder", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/c8/71/d4/boulderkc.jpg", "Date": "24 November 2014", "management_response": "DriscoManager, General Manager at Hotel Drisco, responded to this review, 1 week ago Dear Guest, You're correct, we don't have a restaurant at the Hotel Drisco, but as of last year we do offer 24 hour room service.

We spent seven nights at this hotel and the entire stay became the best part of our San Francisco experience. Although the hotel is not located near some of the main attractions, the staff was very helpful in explaining the MUNI transportation which was 29.00 for the entire week (and included rides on the cable cars). Also, a town car was available during the week to drop us off at Union Square in the morning. The hotel offers a great complimentary breakfast with all sorts of breads, pastries, cereals, oatmeal, cappucinos, juices, etc. In addition, at night the hotel has cheeses, wine, meatballs, and fruit. One night we were so tired that we actually skipped dinner and ate at their wine reception instead. Also, the concierge called us 1 week prior to check-in to confirm our stay and to see if we wanted to make arrangements for anything. She booked a reservation at a nearby restaurant which was very good (Food Inc.) and had live music on Friday night. We had a city view suite which was rather large and the bed was super comfortable. We borrowed DVDs from their video library and relaxed our aching feet at night. We were there for my birthday and they treated me very well. We received fruit in our room on the first night (because it was a suite) and a bottle of wine for my birthday. It made me feel very special. This hotel goes above and beyond any hotel I've ever stayed at. They provide robes and slippers and have turn down service which includes delivery of chocolate cookies at night. They also provide complimentary bottled water in the room. The hotel is located in the very nice Pacific Heights neighborhood and is a peaceful oasis away from all of the hustle and bustle of the city.

As the hotel was built in the early 1900's it does not feature \"up-to-the-minute\" bathrooms but ours was very nice, clean and had all the trimmings - in fact it was quite luxurious. The complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, and early evening wine and cheese tasting were all excellent with good quality ingredients - as were the in-room meals. There was just a small in room menu but all items were delicious. There were so many complimentary things (breakfast, coffee & tea in the lounge, afternoon tea, wine & cheese tasting in the evenings, car services) which makes guests feel totally comfortable. Why do other hotels not learn to do the same? Sure they may have to increase their rates but once you have paid you don't feel as though you are continually having to get your wallet out again! I cannot say anything but good about this lovely hotel and would unreservedly recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in San Francisico!", "Place": "Auckland Region, New Zealand", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2a/fd/9c/avatar.jpg", "Date": "4 November 2014", "management_response": "DriscoManager, General Manager at Hotel Drisco, responded to this review, 1 week ago Dear Guest, Complimentary amenities are part of what we do best at the Drisco.

The last time we were in SF, we stayed at the Ritz and it was a MAJOR disappointment. This time, I wanted a different experience, neighborhood, and vibe, so I went out on a limb and booked the Hotel Drisco. Simply amazing from check-in to check-out! Where to begin? How about our taxi driving into the beautiful Pacific Heights neighborhood, cresting a steep hill, and pulling up to the lovely Hotel Drisco? Impressed by the pristine, charming exterior, we entered the cozy foyer and were further impressed by the warm welcome (and towels!) we received by the staff. We were offered a room upgrade for a nominal fee and were taken to see the room we'd reserved as well as the upgraded suite so that we could make an informed decision. The lower level room we'd originally chosen was charming, but the suite on the second floor was amazing. No brainer there. Upgrade! As we checked in, were were told about the hotels many amenities - complimentary wine tasting in the evenings, complimentary breakfast, complimentary bicycles, complimentary movies (although, unless I missed it, I didn't see \"So I Married an Ax Murderer\" in the San Francisco section - it should definitely be added!), complimentary wifi, complimentary...you get the picture! It is clear the Hotel Drisco's priority isn't making as much extra money off its guests as possible, nay they give so much to their guests, it's a wonder they are MAKING any money at all! Once we were settled into our beautiful, elegantly appointed room, we took a moment to check out the beautiful views from our windows. There is no A/C, which was fine with us. The breezes and city sounds coming through the open windows were splendid. I will note here that I read in previous reviews that the open windows could present a problem because of sounds from other rooms. One evening, we were privy to the late night \"intimacies\" of the guests above us. Meh. Get over it. This sometimes happens in a hotel, with our without open windows. The hotel staff was incredible. Everyone smiling, gracious, friendly. There wasn't one person who behaved as if they didn't enjoy their job, from the gentleman that gave us our bike, to the bellmen, to the restaurant staff (Amati *spelling?* was a particular delight!). Don't miss the ample, delicious buffet breakfast, and definitely don't miss the wine tasting. The latter was less \"tasting,\" more \"have as many glasses of GOOD wine as you want...on us!\" Again, this hotel could be up charging all over the place and yet they don't. Staying here is like being a guest in the home of a very good friend, aesthetically and hospitality-wise. Hotel Drisco, you've got this hotel thing down. Please don't ever change! Last thing I'll note is that the hotel isn't located super close to the touristy stuff (Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, etc.). This was part of the reason we selected it. Nestled in Pac Heights, it's walking distance to the Lyon Street Steps, Fillmore Street, the Presidio, and other less crowded attractions. The Golden Gate Bridge is close by bike or if you're a runner like me and want to run there and back. I just can't say enough about this hotel. It's no surprise they are the #1 San Francisco hotel on Trip Advisor! Excellent job, Hotel Drisco! Again, PLEASE don't change!

The Hotel Drisco is perfect for peace and quiet close to Billionaires Row. The hotel is located on top of a very very steep hill in Pacific Heights. It is on a street of ten million dollar homes, a block from homes that are tens of millions of dollars. It is the only commercial building in a residential neighborhood. Our room was on the ground floor but due to the steepness of the street, once back to our room (at the back of the hotel) we were 3 stories up! And as the hotel is at the top of the hill, the views are as if you are 25 stories high looking down on a sweeping view of the city. The upside of the hotel is that it is far from the maddening crowds- no bums, no craziness (which is also its downside). The hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to the most visited parts of town. We took it to Union square. The hotel staff is extremely friendly. Most guests seemed to be European. There is a lounge with biscottis. In the morning breakfast is complementary- a European style buffet, much nicer than a Residence Inn type buffet, with good smoked salmon, croissants, fruits, fresh juice, cereals etc. From 5 to 6:30 each day there is a wine and hor's d'oeurves reception with a nice selection of wines, cheeses, hummus, nuts, etc. In the evening there are fresh cookies bought to your room. The rooms are upscale with Ipod docking station, noise machine for sleeping and nice toiletries. Our suite had a large living room, nice sized bedroom with desk and large flat screen tv's. As the hotel was built before the 1906 earthquake, the bathrooms are small with only one sink and a tub shower with a curtain- haven't had one of those in 20 years. Also, there is no A/C. This was not a problem as the temps were in the 50's and low 60's in the evening, this being San Fran. We had the windows open at night and as we were in a residential neighborhood, even though it was the weekend, it was absolutely peaceful and quiet all evening long. One issue was the bed. Although the pillows were comfortable, I have a bad back and the bed was horrible for my back. I woke up each morning in lots of pain. My wife found the bed just fine, not having any back issues herself. Another quirk is that there is no parking or valet- however, being a residential neighborhood, parking was easy and ample. Restaurants were walking distance, but one had to navigate up/down the hills. Other than the bed, this is an interesting choice if you are sick of the large hotels on Nob Hill or in Union Square.

This small hotel differentiates itself by its high service values, which it does very well. The hotel is located on a corner in Pacific Heights ideally located to get into the city easily. It has a small, intimate feel, which is reflected in the personal, customer-orientated approach of the staff. Other reviewers have commented on the free afternoon tea, early evening cheese and wine tasting, complementary breakfast - they are all united by being excellent. And the simple free WiFi - just turn on and that's it, no need to register. Oh that other hotels would learn from this. The staff are great too, whether front of house, breakfast service or room service. They are all pleasant and very helpful. I particularly want to thank Bob on reception for his help and advice, and the operations manager, Victor, whom I bombarded with email requests for restaurant bookings before we arrived to ensure the arrangements were perfect for celebrating my wife's 'significant' birthday when we were there. And a thank you to Julio who drive me round for three hours on a very busy afternoon (the air show was on so traffic was clogging the city) helping me get the perfect photo of the Golden Gate Bridge during continually shifting weather. He was aware that it wasn't working out so well because of the traffic and weather so he gave me some extra time for free so I could leave with that 'perfect shot.' This is not an impersonal big chain hotel so if you like anonymity don't come here. The Drisco know they're not a big hotel but more importantly they know how to successfully differentiate themselves in the highly competitive hotel market of SF so that people like me and many others will want to return. And hopefully we will.

I guess over the years I've become accustomed to nicer hotels having a restaurant. I'll usually only dine at the hotel restaurant once or twice, but it can be convenient, and it can be a nice spot to grab a drink after running around touring. The Drisco is located in a residential-only area, so you need to walk 10-15 minutes to get to any dining establishments. The residential area surrounding the Drisco is rather stunning. The homes are those of very wealthy people, and this makes for a nice neighborhood walk. Nonetheless, being in a residential area is a little inconvenient. Everything else is top notch. Great, helpful, friendly staff. Comfortable, attractive rooms with good city views (assuming you have a city view room!). Comfy bed with option to order different pillows. Small comment on the bikes you can borrow from the hotel: my wife's bike kept changing gears on her, and the storage basket kept flopping around, causing balance problems. They are meant to be the kind of bike nobody wants to steal - but, they could still use a little better upkeep. Also, for me personally, I found SF city streets to be very scary! Most city streets don't have a bike lane, so local bikers will just ride along the right side of the road where the cars are parked. What??? That seems crazy, any one of those cars might open the driver side door and...whack! Unless you know the safest biking areas, I do not recommend casual biking as a tourist. This, of course, is not a comment on the hotel at all, just a general SF comment.", "Sleep Quality": "4 of 5 stars", "Place": "boulder", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/c8/71/d4/boulderkc.jpg", "Date": "24 November 2014", "management_response": "DriscoManager, General Manager at Hotel Drisco, responded to this review, 1 week ago Dear Guest, You're correct, we don't have a restaurant at the Hotel Drisco, but as of last year we do offer 24 hour room service.

Although the hotel is not located near some of the main attractions, the staff was very helpful in explaining the MUNI transportation which was 29.00 for the entire week (and included rides on the cable cars). Also, a town car was available during the week to drop us off at Union Square in the morning. The hotel offers a great complimentary breakfast with all sorts of breads, pastries, cereals, oatmeal, cappucinos, juices, etc. In addition, at night the hotel has cheeses, wine, meatballs, and fruit. One night we were so tired that we actually skipped dinner and ate at their wine reception instead. Also, the concierge called us 1 week prior to check-in to confirm our stay and to see if we wanted to make arrangements for anything. She booked a reservation at a nearby restaurant which was very good (Food Inc.) and had live music on Friday night. We had a city view suite which was rather large and the bed was super comfortable. We borrowed DVDs from their video library and relaxed our aching feet at night. We were there for my birthday and they treated me very well. We received fruit in our room on the first night (because it was a suite) and a bottle of wine for my birthday. It made me feel very special. This hotel goes above and beyond any hotel I've ever stayed at. They provide robes and slippers and have turn down service which includes delivery of chocolate cookies at night. They also provide complimentary bottled water in the room.

All members of the staff were friendly, smiling and helpful - nothing was too much trouble! We like to choose boutique hotels where we can when travelling - they are so much more interesting than the big chains! Sometimes you can be disappointed - but with this one we definitely were not.Everything was beautifully presented, the room was very comfortable and had plenty of style. As the hotel was built in the early 1900's it does not feature \"up-to-the-minute\" bathrooms but ours was very nice, clean and had all the trimmings - in fact it was quite luxurious. The complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, and early evening wine and cheese tasting were all excellent with good quality ingredients - as were the in-room meals. There was just a small in room menu but all items were delicious. There were so many complimentary things (breakfast, coffee & tea in the lounge, afternoon tea, wine & cheese tasting in the evenings, car services) which makes guests feel totally comfortable. Why do other hotels not learn to do the same? Sure they may have to increase their rates but once you have paid you don't feel as though you are continually having to get your wallet out again!

The last time we were in SF, we stayed at the Ritz and it was a MAJOR disappointment. This time, I wanted a different experience, neighborhood, and vibe, so I went out on a limb and booked the Hotel Drisco. Simply amazing from check-in to check-out! Where to begin? How about our taxi driving into the beautiful Pacific Heights neighborhood, cresting a steep hill, and pulling up to the lovely Hotel Drisco? Impressed by the pristine, charming exterior, we entered the cozy foyer and were further impressed by the warm welcome (and towels!) we received by the staff. We were offered a room upgrade for a nominal fee and were taken to see the room we'd reserved as well as the upgraded suite so that we could make an informed decision. The lower level room we'd originally chosen was charming, but the suite on the second floor was amazing. No brainer there. Upgrade! As we checked in, were were told about the hotels many amenities - complimentary wine tasting in the evenings, complimentary breakfast, complimentary bicycles, complimentary movies (although, unless I missed it, I didn't see \"So I Married an Ax Murderer\" in the San Francisco section - it should definitely be added!), complimentary wifi, complimentary...you get the picture! It is clear the Hotel Drisco's priority isn't making as much extra money off its guests as possible, nay they give so much to their guests, it's a wonder they are MAKING any money at all! Once we were settled into our beautiful, elegantly appointed room, we took a moment to check out the beautiful views from our windows. There is no A/C, which was fine with us. The breezes and city sounds coming through the open windows were splendid. I will note here that I read in previous reviews that the open windows could present a problem because of sounds from other rooms. One evening, we were privy to the late night \"intimacies\" of the guests above us. Meh. Get over it. This sometimes happens in a hotel, with our without open windows. The hotel staff was incredible. Everyone smiling, gracious, friendly. There wasn't one person who behaved as if they didn't enjoy their job, from the gentleman that gave us our bike, to the bellmen, to the restaurant staff (Amati *spelling?* was a particular delight!). Don't miss the ample, delicious buffet breakfast, and definitely don't miss the wine tasting. The latter was less \"tasting,\" more \"have as many glasses of GOOD wine as you want...on us!\" Again, this hotel could be up charging all over the place and yet they don't. Staying here is like being a guest in the home of a very good friend, aesthetically and hospitality-wise. Hotel Drisco, you've got this hotel thing down. Please don't ever change! Last thing I'll note is that the hotel isn't located super close to the touristy stuff (Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, etc.). This was part of the reason we selected it. Nestled in Pac Heights, it's walking distance to the Lyon Street Steps, Fillmore Street, the Presidio, and other less crowded attractions. The Golden Gate Bridge is close by bike or if you're a runner like me and want to run there and back. I just can't say enough about this hotel. It's no surprise they are the #1 San Francisco hotel on Trip Advisor! Excellent job, Hotel Drisco! Again, PLEASE don't change!

The Hotel Drisco is perfect for peace and quiet close to Billionaires Row. The hotel is located on top of a very very steep hill in Pacific Heights. It is on a street of ten million dollar homes, a block from homes that are tens of millions of dollars. It is the only commercial building in a residential neighborhood. Our room was on the ground floor but due to the steepness of the street, once back to our room (at the back of the hotel) we were 3 stories up! And as the hotel is at the top of the hill, the views are as if you are 25 stories high looking down on a sweeping view of the city. The upside of the hotel is that it is far from the maddening crowds- no bums, no craziness (which is also its downside). The hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to the most visited parts of town. We took it to Union square. The hotel staff is extremely friendly. Most guests seemed to be European. There is a lounge with biscottis. In the morning breakfast is complementary- a European style buffet, much nicer than a Residence Inn type buffet, with good smoked salmon, croissants, fruits, fresh juice, cereals etc. From 5 to 6:30 each day there is a wine and hor's d'oeurves reception with a nice selection of wines, cheeses, hummus, nuts, etc. In the evening there are fresh cookies bought to your room. The rooms are upscale with Ipod docking station, noise machine for sleeping and nice toiletries. Our suite had a large living room, nice sized bedroom with desk and large flat screen tv's. As the hotel was built before the 1906 earthquake, the bathrooms are small with only one sink and a tub shower with a curtain- haven't had one of those in 20 years. Also, there is no A/C. This was not a problem as the temps were in the 50's and low 60's in the evening, this being San Fran. We had the windows open at night and as we were in a residential neighborhood, even though it was the weekend, it was absolutely peaceful and quiet all evening long. One issue was the bed. Although the pillows were comfortable, I have a bad back and the bed was horrible for my back. I woke up each morning in lots of pain. My wife found the bed just fine, not having any back issues herself. Another quirk is that there is no parking or valet- however, being a residential neighborhood, parking was easy and ample. Restaurants were walking distance, but one had to navigate up/down the hills. Other than the bed, this is an interesting choice if you are sick of the large hotels on Nob Hill or in Union Square.

This small hotel differentiates itself by its high service values, which it does very well. The hotel is located on a corner in Pacific Heights ideally located to get into the city easily. It has a small, intimate feel, which is reflected in the personal, customer-orientated approach of the staff. Other reviewers have commented on the free afternoon tea, early evening cheese and wine tasting, complementary breakfast - they are all united by being excellent. And the simple free WiFi - just turn on and that's it, no need to register. Oh that other hotels would learn from this. The staff are great too, whether front of house, breakfast service or room service. They are all pleasant and very helpful. I particularly want to thank Bob on reception for his help and advice, and the operations manager, Victor, whom I bombarded with email requests for restaurant bookings before we arrived to ensure the arrangements were perfect for celebrating my wife's 'significant' birthday when we were there. And a thank you to Julio who drive me round for three hours on a very busy afternoon (the air show was on so traffic was clogging the city) helping me get the perfect photo of the Golden Gate Bridge during continually shifting weather. He was aware that it wasn't working out so well because of the traffic and weather so he gave me some extra time for free so I could leave with that 'perfect shot.' This is not an impersonal big chain hotel so if you like anonymity don't come here. The Drisco know they're not a big hotel but more importantly they know how to successfully differentiate themselves in the highly competitive hotel market of SF so that people like me and many others will want to return.

Sure, there are worse places to stay, it's inoffensive, the location is good, but it's simply nothing special. Certainly not \"boutique\", rather bland, with worn and old-fashioned furniture. (The bathrooms are better than the rooms.) The mattress in my room (405) had a stain. But the worst is the bar. Brightly lit, with two plastic benches, nobody (understandably) uses it for complete lack of style and comfort - even though there are free snacks. There is also no restaurant, no spa, no sports facilities. This hotel is simply too expensive for what it offers. You will also notice that the hotel's reaction to negative reviews is always the same - it's a copy & paste job from previous responses. Management says that they will take this feedback to heart, but even though my points have been made my many others before over the last 2 years, I can't see any improvement (apart from the wifi maybe which I did not experience any issue with).

The TV appeared new and worked well. The bathroom was large with a shower/tub comb...plenty of hot water.

They do have a small bar with a happy hour in the afternoon. (I think M-F?) Breakfast is served every morning, but seemed a little pricey for us. We will stay here again!

We stayed the week before Thanksgiving and the location was great for our needs. I mentioned in advance that during our stay it was our anniversary and the hotel made a point to acknowledge the fact upon our arrival. The room was excellent with a very comfortable bed. The TV appeared new and worked well. The bathroom was large with a shower/tub comb...plenty of hot water. The location turned out to be just what we needed to get around without the use of taxis only. One block either direction and you can take the cable car or bus to many of the major tourist areas. They do have a small bar with a happy hour in the afternoon. (I think M-F?) Breakfast is served every morning, but seemed a little pricey for us. We will stay here again!

Sure, there are worse places to stay, it's inoffensive, the location is good, but it's simply nothing special. Certainly not \"boutique\", rather bland, with worn and old-fashioned furniture. (The bathrooms are better than the rooms.) The mattress in my room (405) had a stain. But the worst is the bar. Brightly lit, with two plastic benches, nobody (understandably) uses it for complete lack of style and comfort - even though there are free snacks. There is also no restaurant, no spa, no sports facilities. This hotel is simply too expensive for what it offers. You will also notice that the hotel's reaction to negative reviews is always the same - it's a copy & paste job from previous responses. Management says that they will take this feedback to heart, but even though my points have been made my many others before over the last 2 years, I can't see any improvement (apart from the wifi maybe which I did not experience any issue with).
