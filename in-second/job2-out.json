Hotel as such is located on a perfect place - walking distance to Montmartre, Champs Elysees, Eiffel tower... And easily accessible from Orly airport (taxi approx. 50 EUR). And, what's the best - you may feel that the hotel is different than the army of others (unified Mercures, Hiltons..).

I recently traveled on business to Paris and was looking for a hotel that would fit into my budget but would also be easy to use as a base for my short trip. I really can't say enough about the room, service and experience. Upon arrival quite early in the morning, I was checked into my room while I was encouraged to take advantage of the buffet breakfast. Breakfast was lovely with a large assortment from which to choose -- hot items like eggs and accompaniments, as well as an assortment of breads, pastries, yogurt, salmon, cheese, salad, etc. It was delicious and very enjoyable. The service was beyond excellent, and the breakfast area plays into the movie theme of the hotel with movie-style seats and director's chairs. After finishing breakfast, I was able to get access to my room right away, which was very helpful since I had just arrived from the US. The superior room was on the small side but was furnished in a beautiful and thoughtful way that took good advantage of the space. Although there was no closet, there was a rack to hang items and a comfortable desk. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was very clean. The room had many nice touches. One was the minibar that included sodas, water and juice -- all complimentary and restocked each day. There was a coffee maker and a safe. My room faced the back (or side) of the hotel and was very quiet with a lovely view of other buildings. A few sweets were left in the room, and it is also worth mentioning that they have a daily snack in the lobby that includes soft drinks and pastries. A nice unexpected touch. The bathroom was well appointed with L'Occitane amenities and plenty of towels and robes. There was plenty of space in the bathroom for cosmetics, and the shower was very good with excellent water pressure. The staff was unparalleled, and there is nothing that they could have done any better. Checking in and checking out was efficient and friendly. I asked for a restaurant recommendation one night and was sent to a lovely restaurant within walking distance. Advice with transportation, reservations, was given freely and with care. The entire staff was truly amazing! The location proved to be excellent for me with several nearby Metro lines. The area is very walkable, and I enjoyed the area immensely. I really cannot think of many things that could be improved. There is such a high attention to service and to detail; I would not hesitate to stay again and look forward to my return visit!", "Place": "DC", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/7c/avatar063.jpg", "Date": "14 December 2014", "management_response": "", "Badges": "6 reviews 4 hotel reviews Reviews in 4 cities", "Location": "5 of 5 stars"}, {"rating": "5 of 5 stars", "room_tip": "", "ReviewerName": "Racingsnakepete", "traveled_as": "Stayed November 2014, travelled as a couple", "title": "Superb little hotel with fantastic staff", "review": "This hotel is well worthy of its high ranking on Tripadvisor.

Had a three night stay in November 2014. The advantages: -- extreme attention to detail in the decor, which varies by floor and room -- comfortably appointed rooms (although note that the premium level is the largest and the rest can be tight for 2 people with luggage) -- Quiet if not facing Blvd. Sebastopol (which is a major N-S artery) -- those rooms facing the street have more light and a little view; triple glazed windows cut road noise but it's still there -- Excellent breakfast (included in room cost) - meats, cheeses, scrambled eggs, fruit, pastries.... -- Very helpful front desk staff (made good recommendations to help us find vegetarian and gluten free food) -- small but workable work-out area -- nice breakfast/bar area (bar not open Sunday/Monday nights) A few other things to consider - the hotel is about a 50 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower area; seems safe enough in the area even at night although it's not a heavily traveled area on foot at night. There is a metro stop across the street. Do consider room size and ask questions - the deluxe, superior and premium descriptors used on the website don't really tell you much about size. The area the hotel is located in is not what I'd call charming - it seems to be a wholesale shopping area, combined with some high priced furniture (e.g, Roche Bobois).

Staying here for two nights was a complete surprise. First impressions of the hotel was that it was very grand looking. The staff were very friendly and helpful as soon as we arrived, we were showed straight to our room regardless of arriving early. We were advised straight away that the roof top pool was out of use but that they could give us access to a local one in another hotel. The hotel kindly upgraded us to a beautiful suite which was amazing, with a huge surprise bouquet and bottle of champagne waiting for me that my now fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had organised. We also had a fruit basket courtesy of the hotel. Our room overlooked the gardens, which was a beautiful setting and extremely peaceful. the second day, we had the most amazing breakfast in our room, which arrived bang on the time we requested. When we later returned that day a beautiful cake and another bottle of champagne was again waiting, another surprise my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 organised. We then went to eat in their restaurant L'epicure, which was amazing and definitely worth booking a table there. The only cons of our stay here was that I expected there to be a tea and coffee making facility in the room and did not expect to have to pay for wifi when we had paid so much already for the hotel. It worked out so much cheaper to use my own data with my mobile network. We also asked for two shirts to be ironed which we were charged for express service on top of the price, we did not request express service as it was not needed the same day, however the hotel deducted this straight away without question. The final con was that the hotel has a hotel cat, which is a big fear for me, luckily I only saw it once which was when it ran into the restaurant which I think is unhygienic and put me on edge, but the waitress very kindly removed it as soon as we advised I did not like cats.

But this little place was one of those finds that you just wish to rave about! The ApartoSuites from the street at ground level don't appear to be anything special. It's not until you go up the front steps into the reception area that you take in some of the quirky and cool aspects of the building. The check in was faultless and rapid. Although I have a rudimentary handle on Spanish and try to practice it wherever I go, the clerk on reception was very happy to converse in Spanish and switch to English when it was needed. Upon entering the foyer I was instantly impressed by how clean it was and then secondly impressed by the furnishings and some of the cool and quirky decor. On arriving at my room, I was again a little aghast at how clean, large and well presented the room was. But it's the view from the balcony that just blew me away (photo below). Incredible.... just incredible. On the roof (terrace) of the hotel is a beautiful outdoor area (shown in the official hotel photo above) that would be just perfect in the warmer months. As I was here in November, the hotel was no longer service food up on the terrace, but I made my way up there was a few drinks and sat and ogled the amazing view that was the Palace across the road. There is also a motor museum in the lower levels of the hotel and this is also well worth a view (especially if you are a bit of a motoring enthusiast). Not something you see everyday in the bowels of a hotel, that's for sure! The hotel is just outside the main city centre and is an easy 20 minute walk to the majority of landmarks in central Madrid. There are plenty of little cantinas or Cervesarias close to the hotel and you are spoiled for choice really. Madrid is an amazing city to visit anyway, but staying at the ApartoSuites just made it all that much easier to enjoy. If you are looking for good value accommodation, great location and easy access to pretty much the entire city, then this is the place for you!

Interior decor aside, I was surprised to be charged 19\u00e2\u0082\u00ac per day for WIFI. Very unusual and penny pinching to charge for Internet connection.

You can definitely feel the palace vibe when you walk in. Eating and drinking at the hotel is pricey but there are various restaurants and bars nearby where you can eat and drink for a third of the price. Room Tip: Choose a room facing the museums See more room tips", "Value": "4 of 5 stars", "Place": "Los Angeles, California", "ReviewerImage": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/69/avatar047.jpg", "Date": "8 December 2014", "management_response": "Paloma H, Manager at The Westin Palace Madrid, responded to this review, 5 days ago Dear Tripadvisor, Thank you so much for taking the time to write your review about your recent stay with us.

From the registration process through checkout, the staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Our room (418), overlooking the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, was large bright. We opted for the hotel breakfast and while expensive at 45 \u00e2\u0082\u00ac for two, it had everything we wanted buffet style including an omelet chef. Given the need to move around in a wheelchair, it was the best way for us to start the day without going out in the cold and rain. We used Madsnailtravel.com for a four hour walking tour of Madrid and a five hour (including train) walking tour of Toledo \u00e2\u0080\u0093 reviewed separately. The not-to-be-missed Thyssen, Prado and Sophia museums are short walks from the hotel, as are many wonderful restaurants and taverns. The 1912 MUSEO BAR is wonderful looking, but skip if you think \u00e2\u0082\u00ac26 is a bit stiff for a malt. While the Rotunda was good for breakfast, there are too many nice restaurants in the neighborhood to eat dinner there. The hotel is 102 years old, so there are some old design issues which caused some minor problems. The hotel entry has some tough steps coming in from the street and then moving to the upper level for the elevators. The staff moved us around via the luggage elevator. The rooms have been updated over the years, but occasionally feel old. That said, this is an incredible hotel and will be the place for us when we return.
