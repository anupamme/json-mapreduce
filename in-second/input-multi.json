This is luxury at it's best. The rooms are like being in an updated castle. The views are rugged and beautiful; with the Matterhorn as the centerpiece. The cobblestone roads are car less which makes the experience so charming. The room service is great, and the ding is wonderful. Room Tip: Rooms on all sides have great views.

Olympic gold medallist and skiing legend Pirmin Zurbriggen himself was kind enough to pick us up at the train station and drive us through Zermatt's oh-so-Swiss streets to the hotel on the edge of town (but within 1200m walking distance of everything). We had an apartment booked, but they showed us the top floor Olympia Suite and offered us a rate that was too good to refuse (can't say if this happens often). So we moved into this light, airy, spacious and beautiful apartment. The views of the majestic Matterhorn from up there must be the very best in Zermatt, with the bedroom, living room and lounge area all having floor to ceiling windows and their own balconies with lounges. Simply stunning. Breakfast is made to order and served every morning in the apartment at your preferred time. It's prompt, freshly made and cheerfully served by the friendly staff. But there is a whole world of awesome facilities at the Zurbriggen, available to all guests and among the best we've ever experienced. The indoor pool is heated but not excessively - my advice is to have a sauna followed by a few minutes in the steam room, pop into the scented Erlebnis (Adventure) shower and choose your scent, then finish it off with a very bracing cold rinse, and then jump in the pool. Or just pop out to the very warm infinity spa with unbelievable views up the green valley to Matterhorn. In the afternoon, head down to the lounge for free tea and coffee with home made cake, admire some of Pirmin's medals and trophies (there are others woven into the chandelier of the Olympia Suite), before heading out to dinners. All in all, one of the most energising, amazing hotel stays we have ever had - and we've had a few!
